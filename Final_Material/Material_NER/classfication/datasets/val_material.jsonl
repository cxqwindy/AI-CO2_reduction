Bimetallic gold-copper catalysts have been identified as emerging electrocatalyst candidates, but Cu incorporation typically lowers product selectivity compared with pure Au. Here we show sustained CO selectivity and activity up to 49% Cu content in small （<2 nm）, thiol-capped Au/Cu nanoparticles （NPs）.

Au/Cu NPs synthesized without thiol ligands selectively produced H-2, whereas larger （>10 nm）, thermally dethiolated Au/Cu NPs produced a wider product distribution including H-2, CO, and C2H4. Density functional theory （DFT） modeling of CO2RR and H-2 evolution at realistic, thiol-capped Au/Cu NP structures indicated that copper thiol surface structures sustained CO selectivity by stabilizing key *CO intermediates while making *H binding less favorable. Calculations also predicted that removing a significant fraction of the thiol ligands would increase *CO binding strength such that desorption of CO product molecules could become the most thermodynamically challenging step. This result, coupled with increased *H stability on dethiolated nanoclusters, points to decreased CO2RR selectivity for small, ligand-free catalysts, which is in line with experimental observations from our group and others.

Bimetallic AgCu foams prepared by hydrogen bubble templated electrodeposition shift the potentials of CO production to more positive values compared to bulk silver. The presence of Ag during the electrodeposition significantly changed the size and the shape of the dendrites in the pore walls of AgCu foams compared to Cu foam.

Controlled potential electrolysis of CO2 using an MT-Cu electrode at -1.8 V at Ag/AgCl exhibits greater selectivity for C-2 products than an unmodified polycrystalline Cu electrode （bare Cu）.

Here, an anti-swelling anion exchange ionomer （AEI） was first proposed to optimize the local environment for promoting industrial-current-density CO2-to-C2sp electroreduction. Taking the anti-swelling AEI-modified oxide-derived Cu nanosheets as an example, in situ Raman spectroscopy and contact angle measurements revealed that the OH--accumulated-N（CH3）（3）（sp） groups and anti-swelling backbone of AEI could synergistically regulate the local pH level and water content. In situ Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy and theoretical calculations demonstrated that the higher local pH value could lower the energy barrier for the rate-limiting COCO* hydrogenated to COCOH* from 0.08 to 0.04 eV, thereby boosting the generation of C2sp products. Owing to the anti-swelling backbone, the optimized water content of 3.5% could suppress the competing H-2 evolution and hence facilitate the proton-electron transfer step for C2sp production. As a result, the anti-swelling AEI-modified oxide-derived Cu nanosheets achieved a C2sp Faradaic efficiency of 85.1% at a current density up to 800 mA cm（-2） with a half-cell power conversion efficiency exceeding 50%, outperforming most reported powder catalysts.

In this study, we have employed size-controlled （similar to 5 nm） Cu100-xZnx nanoparticles （NPs） supported on carbon to investigate the correlation between their structure and composition and catalytic performance. By tuning the concentration of Zn, a drastic increase in CH4 selectivity （similar to 70% Faradaic efficiency （F.E.）） could be achieved for Zn contents from 10 to 50, which was accompanied by a suppression of the H-2 production. Samples containing a higher Zn concentration displayed significantly lower CH4 production and an abrupt switch in the selectivity to CO. Lack of metal leaching was observed based on quasi in situ X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy （XPS）. Operando X-ray absorption fine structure （XAFS） spectroscopy measurements revealed that the alloying of Cu atoms with Zn atoms takes place under reaction conditions and plays a determining role in the product selectivity. Time -dependent XAFS analysis showed that the local structure and chemical environment around the Cu atoms continuously evolve during CO2RR for several hours. In particular, cationic Zn species initially present were found to get reduced as the reaction proceeded, leading to the formation of a CuZn alloy （brass）. The evolution of the Cu-Zn interaction with time during CO2RR was found to be responsible for the change in the selectivity from CH4 over Cu-ZnO NPs to CO over CuZn alloy NPs. This study highlights the importance of having access to in depth information on the interplay between the different atomic species in bimetallic NP electrocatalysts under operando reaction conditions in order to understand and ultimately tune their reactivity.

To find out how the superior catalytic performance was achieved, hollow Au-Cu NP/C was then annealed in O-2 and N-2. It was found that after being annealed, the catalysts almost totally lost the activity towards CO2RR, which may be due to the partial segregation of Cu species on the nanoparticle surface as well as a decrease in the surface defect density with the improvement in crystallinity.

The Cu surface, when decorated with an optimal amount of Sn, resulted in a Faradaic efficiency （FE） for CO greater than 90% and a current density of -1.0 mA cm（-2） at -0.6 V vs RHE, compared to the CO FE of 63% and -2.1 mA cm（-2） for OD-Cu. Excess Sn on the surface caused H-2 evolution with a decreased current density. X-ray diffraction （XRD） suggests the formation of Cu Sn alloy. Auger electron spectroscopy of the sample surface exhibits zerovalent Cu and Sn after the electrodeposition step. Density functional theory （DFT） calculations show that replacing a single Cu atom with a Sn atom leaves the d-band orbitals mostly unperturbed, signifying no dramatic shifts in the bulk electronic structure. However, the Sn atom discomposes the multifold sites on pure Cu, disfavoring the adsorption of H and leaving the adsorption of CO relatively unperturbed. Our catalytic results along with DFT calculations indicate that the presence of Sn on reduced OD-Cu diminishes the hydrogenation capability-i.e., the selectivity toward H-2 and HCOOH-while hardly affects the CO productivity. While the pristine monometallic surfaces （both Cu and Sn） fail to selectively reduce CO2, the Cu Sn bimetallic electrocatalyst generates a surface that inhibits adsorbed H*, resulting in improved CO FE.

We find that the addition Cl- and Br- results in an increased CO selectivity. On the contrary, in the presence of I- the selectivity toward CO drops down and instead methane formation is enhanced up to 6 times compared with the halide-free electrolyte. Even though Br- and I- can induce morphology changes of the surface, the modification in the catalytic performance of Cu is mainly attributed to halides adsorption on the Cu surface. We hypothesizes that the adsorption of halides alters the catalytic performance of Cu by increasing the negative charge on the surface according to the following order: Cl- < Br- < I-. In the case of adsorbed I-, the induced negative charge has a remarkably positive effect favoring the protonation of CO.

Ag and Cu remain fully phase-segregated in the as deposited bimetallic foam exhibiting a high degree of dispersion of pure nm-sized Ag domains embedded in the Cu matrix.

The characterization and experimental results indicate that the high contents of pyrrolic-N and Cu-N species formed at the annealing temperature of 400 degrees C can facilitate the C-2-product generation on a Cu surface, with the reaction rates and Faradaic efficiencies （FEs） for ethylene and ethanol being r（ethylene） = 5.38 mu mol m（-2） s（-1） （FE = 11.2%） and r（ethanol） = 8.83 mu mol m（-2） s（-1） （FE = 18.4%） at -1.01 V （vs. reversible hydrogen electrode （RHE））, respectively. However, excess graphitic-N and oxidized-N on the Cu surface result in considerable H-2 evolution and a rapid decrease in the CO2RR activity. These may occur due to the differences in the adsorption and valence state affecting the Cu-NC interactions. These results indicate that the catalytic activity on MOF-derived Cu-NC catalysts can be controlled by the N-type species that dominates at the corresponding annealing temperature, offering a new tack for designing highly selective complex catalysts since the electrocatalytic performance of the Cu-NC catalysts remains stable over 8 h.

Metal porphyrins （PorMs） have the extended pi-conjugated backbone with different transition metals, endowing them with unique CO2 reduction properties. However, few works focus on the investigation of symmetric architecture of PorMs as well as their aggregation behavior to CO2 reduction. In this work, a series of Co-II porphyrins （PorCos） with symmetric and asymmetric substituents were used as model of molecular catalysts for CO2 reduction. Owing to the electron donating effect of 2,6-dimethylbenzene （DMB）, bandgaps of the complexes became narrower with the increasing number of DMB. As electrocatalysts, all PorCos exhibited promising electrocatalytic CO2 reduction performance. Among the three molecules, asymmetric Co-II porphyrin （as-PorCo） showed the lowest onset potential of -288 mV and faradaic efficiencies exceeding 93 % at -0.6 V vs. reversible hydrogen electrode, which is highly competitive among the reported state-of-art porphyrin-based electrocatalysts. The CO2 reduction performance depended on pi-pi stacking between PorCo with carbon nanotubes （CNTs） and adjacent PorCos, which could be readily controlled by atomically positioned DMB in PorCo. Density functional theory calculations also suggested that the charge density between PorCo and CNT was highest due to the weak steric hindrance in as-PorCo, providing the new insight into molecular design of catalysts for efficient electrochemical CO2 reduction.

The Cu doping concentrations and Cu-Nx configurations were well-tuned by the pyrolysis temperature. At a high Cu concentration of 4.9%mol, the distance between neighboring Cu-N-x species was close enough to enable C-C coupling and produce C2H4. In contrast, at Cu concentrations lower than 2.4%（mol）, the distance between Cu-Nx species was large so that the electrocatalyst favored the formation of CH4 as C-1 products. Density functional theory calculations further confirmed the capability of producing C2H4 by two CO intermediates binding on two adjacent Cu-N-2 sites, while the isolated Cu-N-4, the neighboring Cu-N-4, and the isolated Cu-N-2 sites led to formation of CH4.

Among the different actions proposed for mitigation of CO2 emissions, electrocatalytic reduction appears as a very promising technology for recycling CO2 to synthetic fuels and other valuable products. One of the most important challenges of this technology is the development of catalysts that allow obtaining high efficiencies in the reduction of the CO2 molecule. This work is focused in the development of Cu based nanostructured catalysts deposited on carbon supports. Supercritical fluid deposition （SFD） technique has been used for the copper deposition on three different carbon supports: carbon black （CB）, carbon nanotubes （CNT） and reduced graphene oxide （rGO）. SFD is an environmentally friendly technology that has demonstrated good results in the synthesis of nanomaterials. Results obtained in this work show that SFD technique allows a homogeneous deposition of copper nanoparticles on the different carbon supports used with deposition yields close to 90%. The average size of copper nanoparticles formed is between 13 and 19 nm. The activity of these catalysts （Cu/CB, Cu/CNT and Cu/rGO） in the electrocatalytic reduction of carbon dioxide has been carried out in gas phase in a PEM type electrochemical cell. Results show a higher CO2 conversion rate （around 40%） when using Cu/CNT catalyst. In every case, CO, formic acid and methane are the main reaction products obtained from the CO2 reduction. Nevertheless, Cu/CNT and Cu/CB catalysts promote the formation of CO, whereas formic acid is the main reaction product with Cu/rGO. This could be attributed to the presence of oxygenated groups observed in the rGO based catalyst.

In this work, Au@Cu core-shell nanoparticles with well-defined surface structures were synthesized and evaluated as catalysts for the electrochemical reduction of carbon dioxide in neutral medium. The activation potential, the product distribution and the long term durability of this catalyst were assessed by electrochemical methods, on-line electrochemical mass spectrometry （OLEMS） and on-line high performance liquid chromatography. Our results show that the catalytic activity and the selectivity can be tweaked as a function of the thickness of Cu shells.

Better catalysts that exhibit high activity and especially high selectivity for specific products are needed. Here a range of bimetallic Cu-Pd catalysts with ordered, disordered, and phase-separated atomic arrangements （Cu-at:Pd-at = 1:1）, as well as two additional disordered arrangements （Cu3Pd and CuPd3 with Cu-at:Pd-at = 3:1 and 1:3）, are studied to determine key factors needed to achieve high selectivity for C1 or C2 chemicals in CO2 reduction.

The phase-separated CuPd and Cu3Pd achieve higher selectivity （>60%） for C2 chemicals than CuPd3 and ordered CuPd, which suggests that the probability of dimerization of Cl intermediates is higher on surfaces with neighboring Cu atoms.

Here we report that polycrystalline Cu nanoparticles （denoted as Cu-s） with rich high-index facets, derived from Cu2-xS through desulphurization and surface reconstruction, offer an excellent platform for investigating the role of surface reconstruction in electrocatalytic CO2 conversion. During the formation of Cu-s catalyst, the two stages of desulphurization and surface reconstruction can be clearly resolved by in situ X-ray absorption spectroscopy and OH- adsorption characterizations, which are well correlated with the changes in electrocatalytic performance.

Among the various transition metals, copper has attracted attention as it yields more reduced and C2 products even while using mononuclear copper center as catalysts. In addition, it is found that reversible formation of copper nanoparticle acts as the real catalytically active site for the conversion of CO2 to reduced products. Here, it is demonstrated that the dinuclear molecular copper complex immobilized over graphitized mesoporous carbon can act as catalysts for the conversion of CO2 to hydrocarbons （methane and ethylene） up to 60%. Interestingly, high selectivity toward C2 product （40% faradaic efficiency） is achieved by a molecular complex based hybrid material from CO2 in 0.1 m KCl. In addition, the role of local pH, porous structure, and carbon support in limiting the mass transport to achieve the highly reduced products is demonstrated. Although the spectroscopic analysis of the catalysts exhibits molecular nature of the complex after 2 h bulk electrolysis, morphological study reveals that the newly generated copper cluster is the real active site during the catalytic reactions.
