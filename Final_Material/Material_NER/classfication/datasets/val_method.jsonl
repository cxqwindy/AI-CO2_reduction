An impediment to enabling deep CO2 reduction to oxygenates and hydrocarbons （e.g., C2sp compounds） is the difficulty of coupling carbon-carbon bonds efficiently. Copper in the sp1 oxidation state has been thought to be active for catalyzing C2sp formation, whereas it is prone to being reduced to Cu-0 at cathodic potentials. Here we report that catalysts with nanocavities can confine carbon intermediates formed in situ, which in turn covers the local catalyst surface and thereby stabilizes Cusp species.

One of the most important challenges of this technology is the development of catalysts that allow obtaining high efficiencies in the reduction of the CO2 molecule. This work is focused in the development of Cu based nanostructured catalysts deposited on carbon supports. Supercritical fluid deposition （SFD） technique has been used for the copper deposition on three different carbon supports: carbon black （CB）, carbon nanotubes （CNT） and reduced graphene oxide （rGO）. SFD is an environmentally friendly technology that has demonstrated good results in the synthesis of nanomaterials. Results obtained in this work show that SFD technique allows a homogeneous deposition of copper nanoparticles on the different carbon supports used with deposition yields close to 90%. The average size of copper nanoparticles formed is between 13 and 19 nm. The activity of these catalysts （Cu/CB, Cu/CNT and Cu/rGO） in the electrocatalytic reduction of carbon dioxide has been carried out in gas phase in a PEM type electrochemical cell. Results show a higher CO2 conversion rate （around 40%） when using Cu/CNT catalyst. In every case, CO, formic acid and methane are the main reaction products obtained from the CO2 reduction. Nevertheless, Cu/CNT and Cu/CB catalysts promote the formation of CO, whereas formic acid is the main reaction product with Cu/rGO. This could be attributed to the presence of oxygenated groups observed in the rGO based catalyst.

However, traditional metal electrodes suffer from higher overpotentials, low activities, and poor selectivity. In this article, the pulse electrodeposition （P-ED） method is employed to prepare a copper electrode for ERC. The P-ED method can easily create Cu coatings on carbon paper with a much rougher surface and extended surface area, which is highly beneficial for improving their activity and selectivity. As a result, the prepared Cu electrodes exhibit high faradaic efficiency （of 85% at -2.8 V） and enhanced partial current density （jCH（4） = 38 mA cm（-2）） for methane, which is by far the highest value ever reported at room temperature and ambient pressure. The enhanced activity is attributed to the extended reactive areas with rough morphology and loosened coating structure to ensure CO2 access the reaction sites located at the sublayers of the deposited Cu coatings. The prominent selectivity for CH4 is likely due to the presence of a stepped surface, which is formed by introduction of Cu （100） step into Cu （111） and Cu （220） terraces during the P-ED processes. The lower resistance to the one-electron transfer to CO2, which is a pre equilibrium step prior to the rate-limiting nonelectrochemical step, is another positive factor to improve the ERC activity for CH4. Furthermore, we surprisingly find that the activity and selectivity of the Cu electrode can be easily recovered through continuous CO2 bubbling.

Herein, a new strategy is presented for CO2 reduction with improved C2H4 selectivity on a Cu catalyst by using CO2 capture materials as the support at ambient pressure. N-doped carbon （NxC） was synthesized through high-temperature carbonization of melamine and L-lysine. We observed that the CO2 uptake capacity of NxC depends on both the microporous area and the content of pyridinic N species, which can be controlled by the carbonization temperature （600-800 degrees C）. The as-prepared CuO/NxC catalysts exhibit a considerably higher C2H4 faradaic efficiency （36%） than CuO supported on XC-72 carbon black （19%）, or unsupported CuO （20%）. Moreover, there is a good linear relationship between the C2H4 faradaic efficiency and CO2 uptake capacity of the supports for CuO.

Several approaches including the fabrication of oxide-derived structures, atomic surface control, and the Cusp/Cu interfaces have been primarily used to produce ethanol from CO2.

Unfortunately, the current efficiency of the process is limited by competition with the relatively facile hydrogen evolution reaction. Since multi-carbon products are more valuable precursors to chemicals and fuels than methane, there is considerable interest in modifying copper to enhance the multi-carbon product selectivity. Here, we report our investigations of electrochemical carbon dioxide reduction over CuAg bimetallic electrodes and surface alloys, which we find to be more selective for the formation of multi-carbon products than pure copper: This selectivity enhancement is a result of the selective suppression of hydrogen evolution, which occurs due to compressive strain induced by the formation of a CuAg surface alloy.

Our experimental results show that carbon accumulation vanished and catalytic stability improved after crystal defects had been introduced into nano Cu electrodes. The correlation between the two rules: （1） crystal defects facilitate C2H4 formation while suppress CH4 generation; （2） crystal defects improve catalytic stability, reveals that the C2H4 formation pathway bypasses the carbon deposition associated with CH4 formation and results in stable catalytic performance.

Its faradaic efficiency reached 60% at -1.8 V vs Ag/AgCl. The enhanced stability and activity of the Cu/OLC catalyst can be attributed to the unique catalyst design, wherein a shell of OLC surrounds the Cu NPs. Such a configuration enables the outer layer to act as a filter that protects the Cu surface from adsorption of undesirable species, enhances its electrocatalytic performance, and improves its viability in CO2 electroreduction reaction. The enhanced selectivity of the Cu/OLC catalyst towards the C2H4 production is most likely related to the enhanced electrocatalytic activity of the OLC support towards the CO2 electroreduction to CO. Higher CO surface concentration from CO2 electroreduction on the OLC support, rather than a greater number of available sites for CO dimerization, likely originated this behavior. CO molecules generate on surfaces of OLCs, dimerize on Cu NP （100） planes, and, subsequently, yield additional C2H4 molecules.

During the formation of Cu-s catalyst, the two stages of desulphurization and surface reconstruction can be clearly resolved by in situ X-ray absorption spectroscopy and OH- adsorption characterizations, which are well correlated with the changes in electrocatalytic performance. It turns out that the high CO2 conversion performance, achieved by the Cu-s catalyst （Faradic efficiency of 68.6% and partial current density of 40.8 mA/cm（2） in H-cell toward C2H4 production）, is attributed to the increased percentage of high-index facets in Cu-s during the surface reconstruction.

However, the origin of such enhanced selectivity remains controversial. Here, we prepared two Cu-based electrodes with mixed oxidation states, namely, HQ-Cu （containing Cu, Cu2O, CuO） and AN-Cu （containing Cu, Cu（OH）（2））. We extracted an ultrathin specimen from the electrodes using a focused ion beam to investigate the distribution and evolution of various Cu species by electron microscopy and electron energy loss spectroscopy. We found that at the steady stage of the CO2RR, the electrodes have all been reduced to Cu-0, regardless of the initial states, suggesting that the high C2sp selectivities are not associated with specific oxidation states of Cu. We verified this conclusion by control experiments in which HQ-Cu and AN-Cu were pretreated to fully reduce oxides/hydroxides to Cu-0, and the pretreated electrodes showed even higher C2sp selectivity compared with their unpretreated counterparts. We observed that the oxide/hydroxide crystals in HQ-Cu and AN-Cu were fragmented into nanosized irregular Cu grains under the applied negative potentials. Such a fragmentation process, which is the consequence of an oxidation-reduction cycle and does not occur in electropolished Cu, not only built an intricate network of grain boundaries but also exposed a variety of high-index facets. These two features greatly facilitated the C-C coupling, thus accounting for the enhanced C2sp selectivity.

The surface of h-Cu2O ONS underwent rapid surface reconstruction under CO2RR conditions to exhibit multiple heterointerfaces between Cu2O and Cu phases, setting the preferable condition to facilitate C-C bond formation. Notably, the h-Cu2O ONS obtained the increased C2H4 Faradaic efficiency from 31.9% to 43.5% during electrocatalysis concurrent with the morphological reorganization, showing the role of the stepped surface. Also, the h-Cu2O ONS demonstrated a 3.8-fold higher ethylene production rate as compared to the Cu2O nanocube.  DOI:10.1002_smtd.202200074"}

Bimetallic combinations of Cu with other metals have been investigated with the goal of steering selectivity via creating a tandem pathway through the CO intermediate or by changing the surface electronic structure. Here, we demonstrate a facile cation exchange method to synthesize Ag/Cu electrocatalysts for CO2 reduction using Cu sulfides as a growth template. Beginning with Cu2-xS nanosheets （C-nano-0, 100 nm lateral dimension, 14 nm thick）, varying the Agsp concentration in the exchange solution produces a gradual change in crystal structure from Cu7S4 to Ag2S, as the Ag/Cu mass ratio varies from 0.3 to 25 （CA-nano-x, x indicating increasing Ag fraction）. After cation exchange, the nanosheet morphology remains but with increased shape distortion as the Ag fraction is increased. Interestingly, the control （C-nano-0） and cation exchanged nanosheets have very high faradaic efficiency for producing formate at low overpotential （-0.2 V vs. RHE）. The primary effect of Ag incorporation is increased production of C2sp products at -1.0 V vs. RHE compared with C-nano-0, which primarily produces formate. Cation exchange can also be used to modify the surface of Cu foils. A two-step electro-oxidation/sulfurization process was used to form Cu sulfides on Cu foil （C-foil-x） to a depth of a few 10 s of microns. With lower Agsp concentrations, cation exchange produces uniformly dispersed Ag; however, at higher concentrations, Ag particles nucleate on the surface. During CO2 electroreduction testing, the product distribution for Ag/Cu sulfides on Cu foil （CA-foil-x-y） changes in time with an initial increase in ethylene and methane production followed by a decrease as more H-2 is produced. The catalysts undergo a morphology evolution towards a nest-like structure which could be responsible for the change in selectivity. For cation-exchanged nanosheets （CA-nano-x）, pre-reduction at negative potentials increases the CO2 reduction selectivity compared to tests of as-synthesized material, although this led to the aggregation of nanosheets into filaments.

However, the intrinsic active composition and C-C coupling mechanism of copper-based catalysts are still ambiguous.

In this study, we prepared 1-octyl-3-methylimidazole functionalized graphite sheets （ILGS） in a facile manner by the electro-exfoliation of pure graphite rod in an aqueous solution of 1-octyl-3-methylimidazolium chloride （OmimCl : H2O = 1 : 5, V/V） at 10 V. They were then dispersed in an aqueous solution of copper chloride and sodium citrate. Subsequent reduction with sodium borohydride led to the formation of a composite comprised of cuprous oxide supported on Omimfunctionalized graphite sheets （Cu2O/ILGS）. This composite was found to be an efficient catalyst for the electroreduction of carbon dioxide to ethylene. The as-made materials were characterized by transmission electron microscopy （TEM）, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy （XPS）, Raman spectroscopy, and X-ray diffraction （XRD）. The TEM images showed that the ILGS were composed of multiple layers of graphene. The XRD pattern and Raman spectrum indicated that the surface of the ILGS possessed several defects. In the electro-exfoliation process, the defects in the ILGS were modified in situ by covalent bonding with Omim groups, which was also confirmed by XPS. The Cu2O nanoparticles with an average diameter of 5 nm were uniformly distributed on the surface of the ILGS because the Omim groups grafted to the graphite sheets acted as anchors and prevented their aggregation by the steric effect. The electrocatalytic activities of Cu2O/ILGS for CO2 reduction were measured at different voltages in 0.1 mol L-1 KHCO3 aqueous solution under ambient temperature and pressure. These experiments showed that the catalytic performance of the Cu2O/ILGS composite was determined by cuprous oxide, while the ILGS displayed nearly no catalytic activity in the electroreduction of carbon dioxide. The faradaic efficiency of hydrogen and carbon dioxide reduction products changed with the reaction time because of the reduction of Cu2O to Cu under the electroreduction conditions.

Meanwhile, the electron transferred from catalyst-sites to reaction species also accelerates during CO2RR. Integrating the improved intrinsic activity of Bi catalytic-sites and the superiority of Cu foam in exposing more active sites and the mechanical strength, the BiCu/CF electrode with optimal thickness can acquire satisfactory indicators for industrial application, yielding a record formate current density of 856 mA cm（-2）, higher than 85% Faradic efficiency, along with a remarkable stability, which outperforms state-of-the-art Bi-based catalysts. This study offers potential avenues of engineering orbital delocalization to rationally construct advanced CO2RR electrodes for the carbon-neutral cycle and utilization.

Herein, we demonstrate highly selective production of formate through CO2RR from a CO2-saturated aqueous bicarbonate solution using a porous In55Cu45 alloy as the electrocatalyst. This novel high-surface-area material was produced by means of an electrodeposition process utilizing the dynamic hydrogen bubble template approach. Faradaic efficiencies （FEs） of formate production （FEformate） never fell below 90% within a relatively broad potential window of approximately 400 mV, ranging from - 0.8 to -1.2 V vs the reversible hydrogen electrode （RHE）. A maximum FEformate of 96.8%, corresponding to a partial current density of j（formate） = -8.9 mA cm（-2）, was yielded at -1.0 V vs RHE. The experimental findings suggested a CO2RR mechanism involving stabilization of the HCOO* intermediate on the In55Cu45 alloy surface in combination with effective suppression of the parasitic hydrogen evolution reaction. What makes this CO2RR alloy catalyst particularly valuable is its stability against degradation and chemical poisoning. An almost constant formate efficiency of similar to 94% was maintained in an extended 30 h electrolysis experiment, whereas pure In film catalysts （the reference benchmark system） showed a pronounced decrease in formate efficiency from 82% to 50% under similar experimental conditions. The identical location scanning electron microscopy approach was applied to demonstrate the structural stability of the applied In55Cu45 alloy foam catalysts at various length scales. We demonstrate that the proposed catalyst concept could be transferred to technically relevant support materials （e.g., carbon cloth gas diffusion electrode） without altering its excellent figures of merit.

We report here an investigation of the effects of four different preparations of oxide-derived electrocatalysts on their activity and selectivity for CO2 reduction, with particular attention given to the selectivity to products. All catalysts were tested for CO2 reduction in 0.1 M KHCO3 and 0.1 M CsHCO3 at applied voltages in the range from -0.7 to -1.0 V vs RHE. The best performing oxide-derived catalysts show up to similar to 70% selectivity to C2sp products and only similar to 3% selectivity to C-1 products at -1.0 V vs RHE when CsHCO3 is used as the electrolyte. In contrast, the selectivity to C2sp products decreases to similar to 56% for the same catalysts tested in KHCO3. By studying all catalysts under identical conditions, the key factors affecting product selectivity could be discerned. These efforts reveal that the surface area of the oxide-derived layer is a critical parameter affecting selectivity. A high selectivity to C2sp products is attained at an overpotential of -1 V vs RHE by operating at a current density sufficiently high to achieve a moderately high pH near the catalyst surface but not so high as to cause a significant reduction in the local concentration of CO2. On the basis of recent theoretical studies, a high pH suppresses the formation of C-1 relative to C2sp products.

The uniform planar morphology served as a platform to evaluate the electronic effect isolated from morphological effects while minimizing geometric contributions. The catalytic selectivity and activity of Au-Cu alloys was found to be correlated with the variation of electronic structure that was varied with tunable composition. Notably, the d-band center gradually shifted away from the Fermi level with increasing Au atomic ratio, leading to a weakened binding energy of *CO, which is consistent with low CO coverage observed in CO stripping experiments. The decrease in the *CO binding strength results in the enhanced catalytic activity for CO formation with the increase in Au content. In addition, it was observed that copper oxide/hydroxide species are less stable on Au-Cu surfaces compared to those on the pure Cu surface, where the surface oxophilicity could be critical to tuning the binding strength of *OCHO. These results imply that the altered electronic structure could explain the decreased formation of HCOO- on the Au-Cu alloys. In general, the formation of CO and HCOO- as main CO2 reduction products on planar Au-Cu alloys followed the shift of the d-band center, which indicates that the electronic effect is the major governing factor for the electrocatalytic activity of CO2 reduction on Au-Cu bimetallic thin films.

In this joint experimental-computational work, we exploit structural sensitivity effects to elucidate the ethanol-producing active sites on Cu-Ag CO2RR tandem catalysts. Specifically, methane-selective Cu nano-octahedra （Cu-oh）, enclosed by （111） facets, and ethylene-selective Cu nanocubes （Cu-cub）, enclosed by （100） facets, are mixed with CO-selective Ag nanospheres （Ag-sph） to form Cu-oh-（A）g and Cu-cub-Ag bimetallic catalysts. Ethanol is selectively enhanced via the *CHx-*CO coupling pathway at the terraces of Cuoh-Ag in the CO-enriched environment generated by the Ag-sph. Conversely, on Cu-cub-Ag, ethanol is selectively produced via the same pathway at the edges and corners of Cu-cub, while ethylene continues to be produced at the terraces. The terraces being the predominant surfaces on the catalysts, such facet dependence explains the higher ethanol-to-ethylene ratio on the Cuoh-Ag.

It is found that the faradaic efficiencies for both ethylene and ethanol are enhanced after oxidation/reduction cycling in the presence of halide anions.

Herein, nanostructured Cu2S on Cu-foam was prepared by electro-deposition method and characterized by means of scanning electron microscope （SEM） and X-ray diffraction （XRD）. The Cu2S/Cu-foam electrode was used for the first time in the electrocatalytic reduction of CO2 to HCOOH, and acetonitrile （MeCN） with 0.5 mol . 1-butyl-3methylimidazolium tetrafluoroborate （BmimBF（4）） was used as the electrolyte. It was demonstrated that the electrolysis system was very efficient for the electrochemical reaction, and faradaic efficiency of HCOOH （FEFicooH） and reduction current density could reach 85% and 5.3 mA. cm（-2）, respectively.

The faradaic efficiencies of C-2 compounds produced on CuAg alloy electrodes were varied with the atomic ratio of Cu to Ag. The total value of faradaic efficiencies for these Ct compounds was 53.2% for the pulsed electroreduction on a CuAg alloy electrode （Cu/Ag = 28/72） with an anodic bias of V-a = -0.4 V and a cathodic bias of V-c = -2.0 V bias Ag/AgCl. It was Found that the formation of an oxide layer on Cu and the desorption of intermediates on AE under anodic bias were I;ey factors for the selective reduction of CO2 to C-2 compounds on CuAg alloy electrodes. （C） 2000 The Electrochemical Society.
