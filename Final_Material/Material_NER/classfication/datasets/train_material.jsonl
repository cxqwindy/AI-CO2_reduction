Here, we prepared two Cu-based electrodes with mixed oxidation states, namely, HQ-Cu （containing Cu, Cu2O, CuO） and AN-Cu （containing Cu, Cu（OH）（2））. We extracted an ultrathin specimen from the electrodes using a focused ion beam to investigate the distribution and evolution of various Cu species by electron microscopy and electron energy loss spectroscopy. We found that at the steady stage of the CO2RR, the electrodes have all been reduced to Cu-0, regardless of the initial states, suggesting that the high C2sp selectivities are not associated with specific oxidation states of Cu. We verified this conclusion by control experiments in which HQ-Cu and AN-Cu were pretreated to fully reduce oxides/hydroxides to Cu-0, and the pretreated electrodes showed even higher C2sp selectivity compared with their unpretreated counterparts. We observed that the oxide/hydroxide crystals in HQ-Cu and AN-Cu were fragmented into nanosized irregular Cu grains under the applied negative potentials. Such a fragmentation process, which is the consequence of an oxidation-reduction cycle and does not occur in electropolished Cu, not only built an intricate network of grain boundaries but also exposed a variety of high-index facets.

However, the conversion of CO2 to C2H4 is plagued by low productivity and large overpotential, in addition to the severe competing hydrogen evolution reaction （HER） during the ECR. To address these issues, the design and development of advanced electrocatalysts are critical. Here, we demonstrate fine-tuning of ECR to C（2）H（4 ）by taking advantage of the prominent interaction of Cu with shape-controlled CeO2 nanocrystals, that is, cubes, rods, and octahedra predominantly covered with （100）, （110）, and （111） surfaces, respectively. We found that the selectivity and activity of the ECR depended strongly on the exposed crystal facets of CeO2. The overall ECR Faradaic efficiency （FE） over Cu/CeO2（110） （FE approximate to 56.7%） surpassed that of both Cu/CeO2（100） （FE approximate to 51.5%） and Cu/CeO2（111） （FE approximate to 48.4%） in 0.1 mol.L--（1） KHCO3 solutions with an H-type cell. This was in stark contrast to the exclusive occurrence of the HER over pure carbon paper, CeO2（100）, CeO2（110）, and CeO2（111）. In particular, the FE toward C2H4 formation and the partial current density increased in the sequence Cu/CeO2（111） < Cu/CeO2（100） < Cu/CeO2（110） within applied bias potentials from -1.00 to -1.15 V （vs. the reversible hydrogen electrode）, reaching 39.1% over Cu/CeO2（110） at a mild overpotential （1.13 V）. The corresponding values for Cu/CeO2（100） and Cu/CeO2（111） were FEC2H4 approximate to 31.8% and FEC2H4 approximate to 29.6%, respectively. The C2H4 selectivity was comparable to that of many reported Cu-based electrocatalysts at similar overpotentials. Furthermore, the FE for C2H4 remained stable even after 6 h of continuous electrolysis. The superior ECR activity of Cu/CeO2（110） to yield C2H4 was attributed to the metastable （110） surface, which not only promoted the effective adsorption of CO2 but also remarkably stabilized Cusp, thereby boosting the ECR to produce C2H4. This work offers an alternative strategy to enhance the ECR efficiency by crystal facet engineering. Doi:10.3866_PKU.WHXB202009023"}

The effect is generally attributed to the cathodic deposition of Fe and Zn impurities from the electrolyte. Herein, an experimental-theoretical study shows the existence of potentialand facet-dependent pathways for CO2 reduction to CH4 on Cu. The small-overpotential pathway deactivates the electrodes, while the large-overpotential pathway does not. Theoretical modeling traces the origin of the deactivation to *COH and *CHO, the two *CO hydrogenation products. *COH, which reduces to *C （precursor to coke）, is more stable than *CHO around the equilibrium potential, but its symmetry factor is smaller. Hence, the *COH-based coking pathway opens first until the potential is negative enough for the *CHO-based pathway to dominate. This highlights the often-neglected role of symmetry factors in electrocatalysis design and suggests that small increases in *CHO's symmetry factor can mitigate Cu deactivation.

The C-C coupling process, as the most critical step for generating C-2/multi-carbon fuels, strongly depends on the concentration of *CO intermediates around the active sites. In this work, we prepared porous copper nanospheres （P-Cu） that greatly improved the C-C coupling process by enriching *CO intermediates in the pore structure. The specific pore features of P-Cu were characterized in detail by scanning electron microscopy （SEM）, transmission electron microscopy （TEM）, and nitrogen adsorption/desorption tests. Obviously, the P-Cu exhibits higher specific surface area and richer pore structure than the control sample compact copper nanosphere （C-Cu）. The CO gas sensor and temperature programmed desorption （TPD） tests prove that the P-Cu has better CO adsorption and enrichment capacity than C-Cu due to the rich pore structure.

Copper （Cu） and its oxides are by far the most effective electrocatalysts for this purpose. However, the formation of ethanol using these catalysts is generally less favored in comparison to that of ethylene. In this work, we demonstrate that the selectivity of CO2 reduction toward ethanol could be tuned by introducing a cocatalyst to generate an in situ source of mobile CO reactant. Cu-based oxides with different amounts of Zn dopants （Cu, Cu10Zn, Cu4Zn, and Cu2Zn） were prepared and used as catalysts under ambient pressure in aqueous 0.1 M KHCO3 electrolyte. By varying the amount of Zn in the bimetallic catalysts, we found that the selectivity of ethanol versus ethylene production, defined by the ratio of their Faradaic efficiencies （FEethanol/FEethylene）, could be tuned by a factor of up to similar to 12.5. Ethanol formation was maximized on Cu4Zn at -1.05 V vs RHE, with a remarkable Faradaic efficiency and current density of 29.1% and -8.2 mA/cm（2）, respectively.

This tunability is used to correlate the role of the surface area and catalyst dopants with the selectivity of the CO2RR. The liquid products of the CO2RR are monitored through ex situ nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy. The products' distribution shows that the electrode surface area plays a key role in the electrochemical conversion of CO2 into multicarbon liquid products.

A Sn electrodeposition time of 120 s led to a cathode with a formate Faradaic efficiency of around 81% at -1.1 V vs reversible hydrogen electrode （RHE）, which was more than 37% higher than those of the Sn foil and the sample treated for 684 s.

In this work, surface cavity effect on C2H4 formation was investigated using Cu2O cubes: solid cubes, cavity cubes, and broken cubes, typically representing smooth surface, cavity surface, and rough surface. With respect of C2H4 selectivity, cavity cubes show the significantly enhanced faradaic efficiency （FE） of C2H4, which is 2.7 and 1.7 times higher than those for solid cubes and broken cubes respectively. Moreover, a ratio of CO produced by CO2 reduction reaction （CO2RR） converted to CH4 and C2H4 was calculated to assess the extent of CO further reduction for a catalyst. As noted, cavity cubes exhibited a highest ratio of 29.5%, in contrast with the lower ratio of 13.0% on broken cubes and 14.9% on solid cubes.

To date, copper has been found to be the most effective catalyst for electrochemically reducing carbon dioxide to products such as methane, ethene, and ethanol. Unfortunately, the current efficiency of the process is limited by competition with the relatively facile hydrogen evolution reaction. Since multi-carbon products are more valuable precursors to chemicals and fuels than methane, there is considerable interest in modifying copper to enhance the multi-carbon product selectivity. Here, we report our investigations of electrochemical carbon dioxide reduction over CuAg bimetallic electrodes and surface alloys, which we find to be more selective for the formation of multi-carbon products than pure copper: This selectivity enhancement is a result of the selective suppression of hydrogen evolution, which occurs due to compressive strain induced by the formation of a CuAg surface alloy. Furthermore, we report that these bimetallic electrocatalysts exhibit an unusually high selectivity for the formation of multi-carbon carbonyl-containing products, which we hypothesize to be the consequence of a reduced coverage of adsorbed hydrogen and the reduced oxophilicity of the compressively strained copper. Thus, we show that promoting copper surface with small amounts of Ag is a promising means for improving the multi-carbon oxygenated product selectivity of copper during electrochemical CO2 reduction.

However, understanding the catalytic mechanism of copper oxides electrocatalysts based on identifying their active species is difficult due to the presence of multivalent Cu, such as Cu（0）, Cu（I） and Cu（II） species, during the reaction. Also, developing copper oxides electrocatalysts with high selectivity and long durability for carbon dioxide reduction reaction （CO2RR） is highly desired. Herein, we report the preparation of CuxO decorated graphene oxides （G-CuxO-T） electrocatalyst by a controllable chemical reduction method. The G-CuxO-2 h electrocatalyst exhibits high selectivity towards HCOOH （81%） with a current density of 19.3 mA cm（-2） at -0.8 V vs RHE, as well as good durability （retaining 87.2% of initial activity after 9 hours continuous operation）. Our study reveals that the observed high performance of G-CuxO-2 h electrocatalyst should not only benefit from the stabilized CO2 center dot- intermediate, but also contribute from the facilitated rate-limiting step of HCOO- desorption, which are both closely related to an optimized Cu（I） content in the electrocatalyst. Moreover, a \"buffering effect\" is proposed to explain the promising durability of G-CuxO-2 h, where Cu（II） species should serve as sacrificial sources to supply Cu（I） from the thick subsurface layers, thereby balancing the content of Cu（I） at the surface and maintaining the activity of the electrocatalyst during the reaction. Our work provides crucial insights into the role of multivalent Cu in CO2 reduction reaction, which are important for designing and preparing copper oxides based electrocatalysts with high selectivity and durability for electrochemical reduction of CO2 into liquid fuels.

In addition to electrochemical measurements, density functional theory calculations were also performed to investigate the adsorption energy of the key intermediate carbon monoxide on the catalyst surface.

Beginning with Cu2-xS nanosheets （C-nano-0, 100 nm lateral dimension, 14 nm thick）, varying the Agsp concentration in the exchange solution produces a gradual change in crystal structure from Cu7S4 to Ag2S, as the Ag/Cu mass ratio varies from 0.3 to 25 （CA-nano-x, x indicating increasing Ag fraction）.

By combining electrochemical measurements with ex situ characterization techniques, such as XRD, STEM, elemental mapping, and XPS, we show that this behavior is caused by the segregation of copper and indium in these materials, resulting in the formation of a heterogeneous nanostructure of Cu-rich cores embedded within an In（OH）（3） shell-like matrix. The evolved catalysts show high electrocatalytic performance at moderate overpotential （i.e., j（CO） > 1.5 mA cm（-2） at -0.6 V vs RHE）.

However, traditional metal electrodes suffer from higher overpotentials, low activities, and poor selectivity. In this article, the pulse electrodeposition （P-ED） method is employed to prepare a copper electrode for ERC. The P-ED method can easily create Cu coatings on carbon paper with a much rougher surface and extended surface area, which is highly beneficial for improving their activity and selectivity. As a result, the prepared Cu electrodes exhibit high faradaic efficiency （of 85% at -2.8 V） and enhanced partial current density （jCH（4） = 38 mA cm（-2）） for methane, which is by far the highest value ever reported at room temperature and ambient pressure. The enhanced activity is attributed to the extended reactive areas with rough morphology and loosened coating structure to ensure CO2 access the reaction sites located at the sublayers of the deposited Cu coatings. The prominent selectivity for CH4 is likely due to the presence of a stepped surface, which is formed by introduction of Cu （100） step into Cu （111） and Cu （220） terraces during the P-ED processes. The lower resistance to the one-electron transfer to CO2, which is a pre equilibrium step prior to the rate-limiting nonelectrochemical step, is another positive factor to improve the ERC activity for CH4. Furthermore, we surprisingly find that the activity and selectivity of the Cu electrode can be easily recovered through continuous CO2 bubbling. This paper provides a facile method to prepare highly effective electrodes for electrochemical conversion of CO2. Doi:10.1021_acscatal.7b00571"}

In this work, a bimetallic, low-entropy state Cu-3 Sn catalyst featuring efficient electrocatalytic CO2 reduction to ethanol is developed. This low-entropy state Cu3Sn catalyst allows a high Faradaic efficiency of 64% for ethanol production, distinctively from the high-entropy state Cu6Sn5 catalyst with the main selectivity toward producing formate.

Herein we propose a solidsolution strategy to stabilize Cu2sp ions by incorporating them into a CeO2 matrix, which works as a self-sacrificing ingredient to protect Cu2sp active species. In situ spectroscopic characterization and density functional theory calculations reveal that compared with the conventionally derived Cu catalysts with Cu-0 or Cu1sp active sites, the Cu2sp species in the solid solution （Cu-Ce-O-x） can significantly strengthen adsorption of the *CO intermediate, facilitating its further hydrogenation to produce CH4 instead of dimerization to give C-2 products. As a result, different from most of the other Cu-based catalysts, Cu-Ce-O-x delivered a high Faradaic efficiency of 67.8% for CH4 and a low value of 3.6% for C2H4.  DOI:10.1021_jacs.1c12212"}

The catalytic selectivity and activity of Au-Cu alloys was found to be correlated with the variation of electronic structure that was varied with tunable composition. Notably, the d-band center gradually shifted away from the Fermi level with increasing Au atomic ratio, leading to a weakened binding energy of *CO, which is consistent with low CO coverage observed in CO stripping experiments. The decrease in the *CO binding strength results in the enhanced catalytic activity for CO formation with the increase in Au content. In addition, it was observed that copper oxide/hydroxide species are less stable on Au-Cu surfaces compared to those on the pure Cu surface, where the surface oxophilicity could be critical to tuning the binding strength of *OCHO. These results imply that the altered electronic structure could explain the decreased formation of HCOO- on the Au-Cu alloys.

DFT calculations indicate that the reconstructed Sn/SnOx interface facilitates formic acid production by optimizing binding of the reaction intermediate HCOO* while promotes Faradaic efficiency of C-1 products by suppressing the competitive hydrogen evolution reaction, resulting in high Faradaic efficiency, current density, and stability of CO2RR at low overpotentials.

In the early stages of the reaction pathway, a selectivity-determining step dictates if the pathway leads to formate （a dead-end） or to CO （and on to multi-carbon products）. Therefore, controlling the adsorption of key intermediates, in order to steer the reaction pathway as desired, is critical for selective CO2 electroreduction. Alloying copper is a strategy in which the composition and electronic properties of the alloy surface can be finely tuned to alter the reaction intermediate adsorption behavior. Herein, through in situ Raman spectroscopy and density functional theory （DFT） calculations, we investigate a composition-dependent selectivity toward CO and formate during CO2 electroreduction on a range of Cu-Sn alloy catalysts. We find that the selectivity shifts from CO to formate generation as the Sn content in the alloy catalyst increases because of a shift in adsorption preference from the C-bound *COOH intermediate to the O-bound *OCHO intermediate. Theoretical DFT calculation results indicate that this selectivity shift is due to a gradual weakening of *COOH adsorption and strengthening of *OCHO that occurs with increasing Sn content. A combination of theoretical Bader charge analysis and experimental X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy revealed the origin of such transformation: upon alloying, charge is redistributed from Sn to Cu, which creates regions of localized positive charge on the Sn sites. Therefore, with increasing tin content, these localized positive sites hinder the nucleophilic attack of the CO2 carbon, making *COOH adsorption （and the CO pathway） less favorable.

However, the use of traditional fossil energy leads to high amounts of carbon dioxide emissions, causing severe greenhouse effects. This, in turn, triggers a series of environmental problems. Harnessing renewable energy such as solar energy, wind energy, and hydropower to replace the traditional energy sources is very urgent. Conversion CO2 into value-added fuels and chemicals could be a useful strategy to mitigate the current energy and environmental crisis. It is well known that Cu-based materials are good electrocatalysts for the electrochemical reduction of CO2 （ECR-CO2）. However, they suffer from some disadvantages such as high overpotential and poor selectivity and durability. Therefore, the development of copper based electrocatalysts with high activity and selectivity is essential. Metal-organic frameworks （MOFs） materials that have the advantages of large specific surface area, tunable pore size and porosity, and highly dispersed unsaturated metal centers can be used as electrocatalysts for CO2 reduction or as precursors for further preparation of catalysts with excellent performance. Through thermal decomposition in an inert atmosphere, metal ions in MOF can be transformed into metal clusters, metal oxides, or even metal mono-atoms. Meanwhile, organic ligands are carbonized into porous carbon materials. The addition of some heteroatoms such as B, N, P, and S to carbon materials has also been shown to be effective in changing the electron state and coordination structure of the catalysts. These heteroatoms combine with carbon atoms to form a new active site, denoted as M-X-C （M is the central metal ion and X is the mixed heteroatom） to enhance the catalytic activity of the ECR-CO2. Herein, pre-synthesized Cu-NBDC MOF （a Cu-based MOF synthesized by using 2-aminoterephthalic acid （NBDC） as ligand） is used as a precursor to anchor Cu2O/Cu on nitrogen doped porous carbon （Cu2O/Cu@NC） by annealing at different temperatures. XPS analysis shows that the Cu-N content in Cu2O/Cu@NC decreases with increasing annealing temperature. Investigation of the ECR-CO2 reveals that Cu2O/Cu@NC can inhibit the HER more effectively compared to Cu2O/Cu@C, thereby improving the overall catalytic activity and multi-electron product selectivity of the ECR-CO2. While the Faradic efficiency of formate （FEformate） increases with increasing temperature, those of ethylene and methane （FEC2H4 and FECH4, respectively） decreases with increasing temperature. Specifically, upon annealing at 400 degrees C, the CO2 Faradic efficiency of Cu2O/Cu@NC-400 is higher than 86% （-1.4 to -1.6 V vs. RHE）, including 20.4% of FEC2H4 （-1.4 V vs. RHE） and 23.9% of FECH4 （-1.6 V vs. RHE）. By contrast, FECH4 （-1.6 V vs. RHE） in the presence of Cu2O/Cu@C-400 without nitrogen doping is only 2.33%, and no C2H4 is detected. These significant differences in the catalytic behavior can be attributed to the fact that Cu-N is conducive for the stable adsorption of the *CH2 intermediate during the ECR-CO2, inhibiting the evolution of H-2. These results indicate that the pathway of the ECR-CO2 and its performance can be effectivel regulated by complexing nitrogen with Cu motifs. Doi:10.3866_PKU.WHXB202006017"}

Cu-based materials are the most promising catalysts to realize C-2 products from CO2 reduction, while, they often suffer from the poor selectivity and efficiency. Here, it is shown that -NH2-modified carbon dots （NCDs） can regulate the electron transfer behavior on Cu/CuO catalyst, and then enhance the CO2 conversion selectivity to C2H4.

Transient photo-induced voltage （TPV） tests are used to reveal the effect of NCDs on electron transfer behavior at the catalyst interface.

Electrochemical methods for methanizing CO2 currently suffer from a combination of low activities and poor selectivities. We demonstrate that copper nanoparticles supported on glassy carbon （n-Cu/C） achieve up to 4 times greater methanation current densities compared to high-purity copper foil electrodes. The n-Cu/C electrocatalyst also exhibits an average Faradaic efficiency for methanation of 80% during extended electrolysis, the highest Faradaic efficiency for room-temperature methanation reported to date.

The improved activity and Faradaic efficiency for methanation involves a mechanism that is distinct from what is generally thought to occur on copper foils.

Due to the chemical instability and lower activity, environmentally stable transition metal oxides （e.g., CuO） are unpopular for CO2 electroreduction catalysis. Here, we demonstrate substitution of Cu with an isomorphic atom, i.e., Ni, in CuO and utilize it for improving the hydrocarbon selectivity by 4 times as compared to that of pristine CuO. Hydrocarbon formation is achieved at the lowest possible applied potential （-0.2 V, reversible hydrogen electrode）. This gives the overpotential of about 0.37 V for methane and 0.28 V for ethylene, the lowest ever reported. Employing the ionic interaction between Ni and Cu, this catalyst suppresses the hydrogen evolution reaction to improve the hydrocarbon selectivity prominently. It is observed that current normalized by the Brunauer-Emmett-Teller surface area gives 15-20 times enhancement in the case of Ni-substituted CuO compared to undoped CuO. The in situ experiments indicate that Ni-doped CuO prefers CO pathways compared to formate, resulting into high hydrocarbon selectivity. The experimental observation is further supported by density functional theory studies, which reveal that the Ni-doped CuO catalyst has a higher limiting potential for CO, electroreduction to CH4 due to the stabilization of the CH2O intermediate on the Cu0.9375Ni0.0625O surface rather than the CHO intermediate, in comparison to the pristine CuO surface.

Herein, a facile oxidative etching of the Au20Cu80 alloy was developed for the synthesis of a monolithic nanoporous core-shell structured AuCu3@Au electrode, which showed a faradaic efficiency （FE） of 97.27% with a partial current density of 5.3 mA cm（-2） at -0.6 V vs. RHE for the production of CO. The FE value is about 1.45 times higher than that over the Au nanocatalyst. Unlike single nanoporous Au, AuCu3@Au maintained an excellent performance in a broad potential window. Furthermore, a 23 cm long nanoporous AuCu3@Au bulk electrode with good ductility was prepared, over which the active current reached up to 37.2 mA with a current density of 10.78 mA cm（-2） at -0.7 V vs. RHE, pushing the reduction of CO2 to industrialization. The unsaturated coordination environment with a coordination number of 8.2 over the shell gold and curved interface determined this high electrocatalytic performance. Density functional theory calculations suggested that the double-dentate adsorption structure in the AuCu3@Au catalyst effectively improves the stability of the *COOH intermediate. The density of states indicates that the introduction of Cu causes the d-band-centre of AuCu3@Au to move toward the Fermi level, directly bonding with *COOH. Therefore, the adsorption of *COOH on the surface of the AuCu3@Au catalyst is strengthened, facilitating the formation of CO.

Cu/SWNT, Cu/RGO and Cu/OLC composite catalysts are synthesized and characterized by X-ray diffraction analysis, transmission electron microscopy and electrochemical surface area measurements. Electrocatalytic activities of the synthesized materials, as measured in an electrochemical cell connected to a gas chromatograph, are compared to that of Cu NPs supported on Vulcan carbon. All four catalysts demonstrate higher activity towards C2H4 generation vs CH4, with production of the latter mostly suppressed on Cu NPs supported on nanostructured substrates. Onset potentials for C2H4 vs CH4 generation demonstrate 200 mV positive shifts for Cu/SWNT, Cu/RGO, and Cu/OLC catalysts. The Cu/OLC catalyst is found to be superior to the other two nanostructured catalysts in terms of stability, activity and selectivity towards C2H4 generation. Its faradaic efficiency reached 60% at -1.8 V vs Ag/AgCl. The enhanced stability and activity of the Cu/OLC catalyst can be attributed to the unique catalyst design, wherein a shell of OLC surrounds the Cu NPs. Such a configuration enables the outer layer to act as a filter that protects the Cu surface from adsorption of undesirable species, enhances its electrocatalytic performance, and improves its viability in CO2 electroreduction reaction. The enhanced selectivity of the Cu/OLC catalyst towards the C2H4 production is most likely related to the enhanced electrocatalytic activity of the OLC support towards the CO2 electroreduction to CO. Higher CO surface concentration from CO2 electroreduction on the OLC support, rather than a greater number of available sites for CO dimerization, likely originated this behavior. CO molecules generate on surfaces of OLCs, dimerize on Cu NP （100） planes, and, subsequently, yield additional C2H4 molecules. Both the reduction of the CO2 to CO on the surface of OLCs and reduction of \"extra\" CO molecules to C2H4 on the surface of Cu NPs are expected to lead to an increase in the local pH, which is also beneficial for the C2H4 production.

However, it is still a challenge to enhance the selectivity of the CO2RR to single multi-carbon （C2sp） product, such as C2H4. Here, an effective method is proposed to improve C2H4 selectivity by inhibiting the production of the other competitive C-2 products, namely C2H5OH, from Cu2O/C composite. Density functional theory indicates that the heterogeneous structure between Cu2O and carbon is expected to inhibit C2H5OH production and promote C-C coupling, which facilitates C2H4 production. To prove this, a composite electrode containing octahedral Cu2O nanoparticles （NPs） （o-Cu2O） with {111} facets and carbon NPs is constructed, which experimentally inhibits C2H5OH production while strongly enhancing C2H4 selectivity compared with o-Cu2O electrode. Furthermore, the surface hydroxylation of carbon can further improve the C2H4 production of o-Cu2O/C electrode, exhibiting a high C2H4 Faradaic efficiency of 67% and a high C2H4 current density of 45 mA cm（-2） at -1.1 V in a near-neutral electrolyte.

These results may provide new insights into the application of gas diffusion electrodes to alleviate mass transfer limitations in electrochemical systems for the transformation of CO2 to alcohols. （C） 2015 Elsevier Inc.

Controlling the surface composition of copper nanomaterials may provide the electronic and structural properties necessary for carbon-carbon coupling, thus increasing the Faradaic efficiency （FE） towards ethylene and other multi-carbon （C2sp） products. Synthesis and catalytic study of silver-coated copper nanoparticles （Cu@Ag NPs） for the reduction of CO2 are presented. Bimetallic CuAg NPs are typically difficult to produce due to the bulk immiscibility between these two metals. Slow injection of the silver precursor, concentrations of organic capping agents, and gas environment proved critical to control the size and metal distribution of the Cu@Ag NPs. The optimized Cu@Ag electrocatalyst exhibited a very low onset cell potential of -2.25 V for ethylene formation, reaching a FE towards C2sp products （FEC2sp） of 43% at -2.50 V, which is 1.0 V lower than a reference Cu catalyst to reach a similar FEC2sp. The high ethylene formation at low potentials is attributed to enhanced C-C coupling on the Ag enriched shell of the Cu@Ag electrocatalysts. This study offers a new catalyst design towards increasing the efficiency for the electroreduction of CO2 to value-added chemicals. Doi:10.1002_adfm.202101668"}

This work demonstrates that dendritic, bimetallic Cu-Bi electrocatalysts with nanometer-sized grains are capable of formate generation with a high selectivity. Optimizing composition of electrocatalyst could achieve a faradic efficiency of 90 % at -0.8 to -0.9 V-RHE, and a partial current of more than 2 mA cm（-2）. The combination of Cu with Bi enables modulation of the adsorption strength of intermediates. This leads to an increased selectivity and suppressed formation of spurious species, especially hydrogen and CO. Comparison of product distribution for Cu-In versus Cu-Bi indicated that Bi is essential to induce a favorable adsorption configuration of the intermediate species and to promote formate production.

Herein, we construct a catalyst model with a sandwich-like structure composed of highly reactive metallic Cu nanosheet that is confined in thin carbon layers （denoted as C/Cu/C nanosheet）. The sandwich-like C/Cu/C nanosheet avoids the oxidation of the active site of metallic Cu at an ambient atmosphere owing to the protective coating of the carbon layer, which inhibits the surface reconstruction that occurs via the dissolution of copper oxides and redeposition of dissolved Cu ions. The as-prepared C/Cu/C nanosheet exhibits a prominent Faradaic efficiency （FE） of 47.8% for CH4 products at -1.0 V with a current density of 20.3 mA.cm（-2） and stable production of CH4 during 12 h operation with negligible selectivity loss. Our findings provide an effective strategy of restraining surface reconstruction for the design of selective and stable electrocatalysts toward CO2RR.  DOI:10.1021_acsami.1c23662"}

In this work, we developed nanosized Cu2O catalysts using the hydrothermal method for electrochemical CO2 reduction to alcohols. Cu2O nanoparticles （NPs） of various morphologies that were enclosed with different crystal facets, named as Cu2O-c （cubic structure with （100） facets）, Cu2O-o （octahedron structure with （111） facets）, Cu2O-t （truncated octahedron structure with both （100） and （111） facets）, and Cu2O-u （urchin-like structure with （100）, （220）, and （222） facets）, were prepared by regulating the content of a polyvinyl pyrrolidone （PVP） template. The electrochemical CO2 reduction performance of the different Cu2O NPs was evaluated in the CO2-saturated 0.5 M KHCO3 electrolyte. The as-synthesized Cu2O nanostructures were capable of reducing CO2 to produce alcohols including methanol, ethanol, and isopropanol. The alcohol selectivity of the different Cu2O NPs followed the order of Cu2O-t < Cu2O-u < Cu2O-c < Cu2O-o （with the total Faradaic efficiencies of alcohol products of 10.7, 25.0, 26.2, and 35.4%）. The facet-dependent effects were associated with the varied concentrations of oxygen-vacancy defects, different energy barriers of CO2 reduction, and distinct Cu-O bond lengths over the different crystal facets. The desired Cu2O-o catalyst exhibited good reduction activity with the highest partial current density of 0.51 mA/cm（2） for alcohols. The Faradaic efficiencies of alcohol products were 4.9% for methanol, 17.9% for ethanol, and 12.6% for isopropanol. The good electrochemical CO2 reduction performance was also associated with the surface reconstruction of Cu2O, which endowed the catalyst with abundant Cu-0 and Cusp sites for promoted CO2 activation and stabilized CO* adsorption for enhanced C-C coupling. This work will provide a new route for enhancing the alcohol selectivity of nanostructured Cu2O catalysts by crystal facet engineering. Doi:10.1021_acsami.1c03850"}
