Cu is exclusive among the eCO（2）RR metallic catalysts in that it facilitates the formation of a range of highly reduced C-2 products, with a reasonable total faradaic efficiency but poor product selectivity. Here, a series of new sulfide-derived copper-cadmium catalysts （SD-CuxCdy） was developed. An excellent faradaic efficiency of around 32 % but with a relatively low current density of 0.6 mA cm（-2） for ethanol was obtained using the SD-CuCd2 catalyst at the relatively low overpotential of 0.89 V in a CO2-saturated aqueous 0.10 m KHCO3 solution with an H-cell. The current density increased by an order of magnitude under similar conditions using a flow cell where the mass transport rate for CO2 was greatly enhanced. Ex situ spectroscopic and microscopic, and voltammetric investigations pointed to the role of abundant phase boundaries between CdS and Cusp/Cu sites in the SD-CuCd2 catalyst in enhancing the selectivity and efficiency of ethanol formation at low potentials.

Optimizing the C-C coupling process, the rate-determining step for C-2 product generation, is an important strategy to improve the production and selectivity of the C-2 products. In this study, we determined that the local electric field can promote the C-C coupling reaction and enhance CO2 electroreduction to C-2 products. First, finite-element simulations indicated that the high curvature of the Cu nanoneedles results in a large local electric field on their tips. Density functional theory （DFT） calculations proved that a large electric field can promote C-C coupling. Motivated by this prediction, we prepared a series of Cu catalysts with different curvatures. The Cu nanoneedles （NNs） exhibited the largest number of curvatures, followed by the Cu nanorods （NRs）, and Cu nanoparticles （NPs）. The Cu NNs contained the highest concentration of adsorbed Ksp, which resulted in the highest local electric field on the needles. CO adsorption sensor tests indicated that the Cu NNs exhibited the strongest CO adsorption ability, and in-situ Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy （FTIR） showed the strongest *COCO and *CO signals for the Cu NNs. These experimental results demonstrate that high-curvature nanoneedles can induce a large local electric field, thus promoting C-C coupling. As a result, the Cu NNs show a maximum FEC2 of 44% for CO2RR at a low potential （-0.6 V vs. RHE）, which is approximately 2.2 times that of the Cu NPs.

Significant advances have already been achieved in understanding how some characteristics of copper electrodes, the current state-of-the-art catalyst for multi-carbon formation via CO2RR, affect the product spectrum. Advances and insights have been reported for, among others, the effect of crystallographic orientation, active surface area, and composition of M-copper （M = Au, Ag, Zn, etc.） materials, and how these alter the distribution of CO2RR products. However, a systematic study evaluating the significance of these variables in the CO2RR to C2sp products is still lacking in the literature and represents an important step in the development of new materials with optimized properties that can be more selective to C2sp compounds. In this paper, we have systematically investigated the effect of the roughness factor, chemical composition, and surface morphology of CuxZny electrocatalysts on the product distribution during CO2RR. Firstly, Cu, Cu90Zn10, and Cu75Zn25 electrodes were exposed to oxidation-reduction cycles to produce Cu and CuxZny electrodes with different morphologies, roughness factors, and chemical composition. Our results show that an increase in the roughness factor and Zn content lead to higher faradaic efficiency （FE） to C2sp products.

Presently Cu is the only metallic electrocatalyst known to reduce CO2 to appreciable amounts of hydrocarbons, but often a wide range of products such as CO2 HCOO-, and H-2 are formed as well. Better catalysts that exhibit high activity and especially high selectivity for specific products are needed. Here a range of bimetallic Cu-Pd catalysts with ordered, disordered, and phase-separated atomic arrangements （Cu-at:Pd-at = 1:1）, as well as two additional disordered arrangements （Cu3Pd and CuPd3 with Cu-at:Pd-at = 3:1 and 1:3）, are studied to determine key factors needed to achieve high selectivity for C1 or C2 chemicals in CO2 reduction. When compared with the disordered and phase-separated CuPd catalysts, the ordered CuPd catalyst exhibits the highest selectivity for Cl products （>80%）. The phase-separated CuPd and Cu3Pd achieve higher selectivity （>60%） for C2 chemicals than CuPd3 and ordered CuPd, which suggests that the probability of dimerization of Cl intermediates is higher on surfaces with neighboring Cu atoms. Based on surface valence band spectra, geometric effects rather than electronic effects seem to be key in determining the selectivity of bimetallic Cu Pd catalysts. These results imply that selectivities to different products can be tuned by geometric arrangements.

Several approaches including the fabrication of oxide-derived structures, atomic surface control, and the Cusp/Cu interfaces have been primarily used to produce ethanol from CO2.

However, the selective electrosynthesis of C2sp products on Cu-0-Cusp interfaces is critically limited due to the low electrocatalytic production of ethanol relative to ethylene. In this study, a novel porous Cu/Cu2O aerogel network is introduced to afford high ethanol productivity by the electrocatalytic CO2RR. The aerogel is synthesized by a simple chemical redox reaction of a precursor and a reducing agent. CO2RR results reveal that the Cu/Cu2O aerogel produces ethanol as the major product, exhibiting a Faradaic efficiency （FEEtOH） of 41.2% and a partial current density （J（EtOH）） of 32.55 mA cm（-2） in an H-cell reactor. This is the best electrosynthesis performance for ethanol production reported thus far. Electron microscopy and electrochemical analysis results reveal that this dramatic increase in the electrosynthesis performance for ethanol can be attributed to a large number of Cu-0-Cusp interfaces and an increase of the local pH in the confined porous aerogel network structure with a high-surface-area.

Here, we prepared two Cu-based electrodes with mixed oxidation states, namely, HQ-Cu （containing Cu, Cu2O, CuO） and AN-Cu （containing Cu, Cu（OH）（2））. We extracted an ultrathin specimen from the electrodes using a focused ion beam to investigate the distribution and evolution of various Cu species by electron microscopy and electron energy loss spectroscopy. We found that at the steady stage of the CO2RR, the electrodes have all been reduced to Cu-0, regardless of the initial states, suggesting that the high C2sp selectivities are not associated with specific oxidation states of Cu. We verified this conclusion by control experiments in which HQ-Cu and AN-Cu were pretreated to fully reduce oxides/hydroxides to Cu-0, and the pretreated electrodes showed even higher C2sp selectivity compared with their unpretreated counterparts. We observed that the oxide/hydroxide crystals in HQ-Cu and AN-Cu were fragmented into nanosized irregular Cu grains under the applied negative potentials. Such a fragmentation process, which is the consequence of an oxidation-reduction cycle and does not occur in electropolished Cu, not only built an intricate network of grain boundaries but also exposed a variety of high-index facets.

It was clearly confirmed that the Au thin layer formed by the electrochemical galvanic displacement on polycrystalline Cu surface resulted in a markedly enhanced performance for the electrochemical reduction of CO2 to CO. The CO Faradaic efficiency for the Au thin layer on Cu was 10.6 and 3.4 times higher than that for the polycrystalline Cu and Au, respectively. It was revealed from the photoemission spectroscopy （PES） studies that the increase of electron population in s-band and the upshift of d-band center position of Au in Au/Cu increased the bond strength with reaction intermediates leading to the enhancement of activity and the selectivity.

In the fabrication procedure, a gold precursor was pre-dissolved in TOP to lower the reduction potential of Au3sp, which could then be reduced by Cu0. The obtained hollow Au-Cu NPs were then supported on carbon black for CO2RR measurement, and it exhibited a maximum CO FE of 53.3% at -0.7 V （vs. RHE）, which was very close to that of Au NP/C, but the gold mass current density of hollow Au-Cu NP/C was much higher. The hollow Au-Cu NP/C also showed good stability in long-time measurements for CO2RR. To find out how the superior catalytic performance was achieved, hollow Au-Cu NP/C was then annealed in O-2 and N-2. It was found that after being annealed, the catalysts almost totally lost the activity towards CO2RR, which may be due to the partial segregation of Cu species on the nanoparticle surface as well as a decrease in the surface defect density with the improvement in crystallinity. Thus, it was concluded that high dispersion of more Au atoms on the nanoparticle surface together with the presence of more surface defect sites could account for the superior CO2RR performance of the as-synthesized hollow Au-Cu NP/C.

The uniform planar morphology served as a platform to evaluate the electronic effect isolated from morphological effects while minimizing geometric contributions. The catalytic selectivity and activity of Au-Cu alloys was found to be correlated with the variation of electronic structure that was varied with tunable composition. Notably, the d-band center gradually shifted away from the Fermi level with increasing Au atomic ratio, leading to a weakened binding energy of *CO, which is consistent with low CO coverage observed in CO stripping experiments. The decrease in the *CO binding strength results in the enhanced catalytic activity for CO formation with the increase in Au content. In addition, it was observed that copper oxide/hydroxide species are less stable on Au-Cu surfaces compared to those on the pure Cu surface, where the surface oxophilicity could be critical to tuning the binding strength of *OCHO. These results imply that the altered electronic structure could explain the decreased formation of HCOO- on the Au-Cu alloys. In general, the formation of CO and HCOO- as main CO2 reduction products on planar Au-Cu alloys followed the shift of the d-band center, which indicates that the electronic effect is the major governing factor for the electrocatalytic activity of CO2 reduction on Au-Cu bimetallic thin films.

The Cu-based precatalysts with structural complexity often undergo sophisticated structural reconstruction processes, which may offer opportunities for enhancing the electrosynthesis of multicarbon products （C2sp products） but remain largely uncertain due to various new structural features possibly arising during the processes. In this work, the Cu2O superparticles with an assembly structure are demonstrated to undergo complicated structure evolution under electrochemical reduction condition, enabling highly selective CO2-to-C2sp products conversion in electrocatalysis. As revealed by electron microscopic characterization together with in situ X-ray absorption spectroscopy and Raman spectroscopy, the building blocks inside the superparticle fuse to generate numerous grain boundaries while those in the outer shell detach to form nanogap structures that can efficiently confine OH- to induce high local pH. Such a combination of unique structural features with local reaction environment offers two important factors for facilitating C-C coupling. Consequently, the Cu2O superparticle-derived catalyst achieves high faradaic efficiencies of 53.2% for C2H4 and 74.2% for C2sp products, surpassing the performance of geometrically simpler Cu2O cube-derived catalyst and most reported Cu electrocatalysts under comparable conditions.

Namely, the Cu2O hollow nanospheres with a size of 150-180 nm were synthesized by a soft template method, and then Au nanoparticles of similar to 7 nm were loaded to obtain Aux/Cu2O composites. The Aux/Cu2O catalysts have an earlier onset for ethanol production than Cu2O. Besides, Aux/Cu2O catalysts display the significantly enhanced Faraday efficiencies （FEs） of CO and ethanol, the suppressed hydrogen evolution reaction and the slightly weakened HCOOH formation. Among them, Au-0.17/Cu2O stands out with the highest FEs of ethanol from 10.8%-16.2% throughout the measuring potentials, suggesting an optimal amount of Au. Furthermore, it is found that the FEs of ethanol increase as the atomic ratio of Au/Cu increases at the medium reduction potentials （-1.1 V to -1.3 V）.

Comparing the production rate and Faradaic selectivity of the major products as a function the working potential in the presence of Cl-, Br-, and I-, we show that the activity and selectivity of Cu depends on the concentration and nature of the added halide. We find that the addition Cl- and Br- results in an increased CO selectivity. On the contrary, in the presence of I- the selectivity toward CO drops down and instead methane formation is enhanced up to 6 times compared with the halide-free electrolyte. Even though Br- and I- can induce morphology changes of the surface, the modification in the catalytic performance of Cu is mainly attributed to halides adsorption on the Cu surface. We hypothesizes that the adsorption of halides alters the catalytic performance of Cu by increasing the negative charge on the surface according to the following order: Cl- < Br- < I-. In the case of adsorbed I-, the induced negative charge has a remarkably positive effect favoring the protonation of CO. These results present an easy way to enhance CH4 production during the CO2RR on Cu. Furthermore, understanding this effect can contribute to the design of new and more efficient catalysts.

The bimetallic electrode was prepared through the electrodeposition of Sn species on the surface of oxide-derived copper （OD-Cu）. The Cu surface, when decorated with an optimal amount of Sn, resulted in a Faradaic efficiency （FE） for CO greater than 90% and a current density of -1.0 mA cm（-2） at -0.6 V vs RHE, compared to the CO FE of 63% and -2.1 mA cm（-2） for OD-Cu. Excess Sn on the surface caused H-2 evolution with a decreased current density. X-ray diffraction （XRD） suggests the formation of Cu Sn alloy. Auger electron spectroscopy of the sample surface exhibits zerovalent Cu and Sn after the electrodeposition step. Density functional theory （DFT） calculations show that replacing a single Cu atom with a Sn atom leaves the d-band orbitals mostly unperturbed, signifying no dramatic shifts in the bulk electronic structure. However, the Sn atom discomposes the multifold sites on pure Cu, disfavoring the adsorption of H and leaving the adsorption of CO relatively unperturbed. Our catalytic results along with DFT calculations indicate that the presence of Sn on reduced OD-Cu diminishes the hydrogenation capability-i.e., the selectivity toward H-2 and HCOOH-while hardly affects the CO productivity. While the pristine monometallic surfaces （both Cu and Sn） fail to selectively reduce CO2, the Cu Sn bimetallic electrocatalyst generates a surface that inhibits adsorbed H*, resulting in improved CO FE.

The stability and selectivity of reported approaches reside below technoeconomic-related requirements. Membrane electrode assembly-based reactors offer a known path to stability; however, highly alkaline conditions on the cathode favour C-C coupling and multi-carbon products. In computational studies herein, we find that copper in a low coordination number favours methane even under highly alkaline conditions. Experimentally, we develop a carbon nanoparticle moderator strategy that confines a copper-complex catalyst when employed in a membrane electrode assembly. In-situ XAS measurements confirm that increased carbon nanoparticle loadings can reduce the metallic copper coordination number. At a copper coordination number of 4.2 we demonstrate a CO2-to-methane selectivity of 62%, a methane partial current density of 136mAcm（-2）, and>110hours of stable operation. Electrochemical conversion of carbon dioxide to methane can store intermittent renewable electricity in a staple of global energy.

Cu30%ZIF-8 showed the highest current density of -40 mA cm（-2） at -2.1 V vs. Ag/AgCl and better selectivity for CH4 and CO compared to previous works on Cu electrodes. This high activity of the Cu-doped ZIF-8 catalyst is because of the crystalline nanostructure of our catalyst with sufficient copper active metal sites and N-content, micro-meso dual-porosity nature of the structure, and broad surface area of zeolite imidazole framework to work on.

We report here an investigation of the effects of four different preparations of oxide-derived electrocatalysts on their activity and selectivity for CO2 reduction, with particular attention given to the selectivity to products. All catalysts were tested for CO2 reduction in 0.1 M KHCO3 and 0.1 M CsHCO3 at applied voltages in the range from -0.7 to -1.0 V vs RHE. The best performing oxide-derived catalysts show up to similar to 70% selectivity to C2sp products and only similar to 3% selectivity to C-1 products at -1.0 V vs RHE when CsHCO3 is used as the electrolyte. In contrast, the selectivity to C2sp products decreases to similar to 56% for the same catalysts tested in KHCO3.

These efforts reveal that the surface area of the oxide-derived layer is a critical parameter affecting selectivity.

Then the effect of Co/Cu, calcination temperature and reduction potential on the FE% of CH4, CO and H（2 ）was investigated. A wider range of CO/H2 ratio from 0.29 to 1.17 can be obtained by adjusting Co/Cu. Mechanism was explored through the acid etching experiments, KSCN solution dipping and XPS spectra analysis. Results indicated that the introduction of metallic Cu greatly promoted the shift of electron in CoCu（1:3）-N-C-900 and its adsorption capacity towards CO2, ultimately improving its electrocatalytic activity.

Modification of electrodeposited copper foam with poly（acrylamide） leads to a significant enhancement in faradaic efficiency for ethylene from 13% （unmodified foam） to 26% at -0.96 V vs RHE, whereas methane yield is unaffected. Effects from crystalline phase distribution and copper oxide phases are ruled out as the source of enhancement through XPS and in situ XRD analysis. DFT calculations reveal that poly（acrylamide） adsorbs on the copper surface via the oxygen atom on the carbonyl groups and enhances ethylene formation by （i） charge donation to the copper surface that activates CO for dimerization, （ii） chemical stabilization of the CO dimer （a key intermediate for C-2 products） by hydrogen-bond interactions with the -NH2 group, and （iii） facilitating the adsorption of CO molecules near the polymer, increasing local surface coverage. Poly（acrylamide） with copper acts as a multipoint binding catalytic system where the interplay between activation and stabilization of intermediates results in enhanced selectivity toward ethylene formation. Modification with poly（acrylic acid） which has a similar structure to poly（acrylamide） also shows some enhancement in activity but is unstable, whereas poly（allylamine） completely suppresses CO2 reduction in favor of the hydrogen evolution reaction.

However, the use of traditional fossil energy leads to high amounts of carbon dioxide emissions, causing severe greenhouse effects. This, in turn, triggers a series of environmental problems. Harnessing renewable energy such as solar energy, wind energy, and hydropower to replace the traditional energy sources is very urgent. Conversion CO2 into value-added fuels and chemicals could be a useful strategy to mitigate the current energy and environmental crisis. It is well known that Cu-based materials are good electrocatalysts for the electrochemical reduction of CO2 （ECR-CO2）. However, they suffer from some disadvantages such as high overpotential and poor selectivity and durability. Therefore, the development of copper based electrocatalysts with high activity and selectivity is essential. Metal-organic frameworks （MOFs） materials that have the advantages of large specific surface area, tunable pore size and porosity, and highly dispersed unsaturated metal centers can be used as electrocatalysts for CO2 reduction or as precursors for further preparation of catalysts with excellent performance. Through thermal decomposition in an inert atmosphere, metal ions in MOF can be transformed into metal clusters, metal oxides, or even metal mono-atoms. Meanwhile, organic ligands are carbonized into porous carbon materials. The addition of some heteroatoms such as B, N, P, and S to carbon materials has also been shown to be effective in changing the electron state and coordination structure of the catalysts. These heteroatoms combine with carbon atoms to form a new active site, denoted as M-X-C （M is the central metal ion and X is the mixed heteroatom） to enhance the catalytic activity of the ECR-CO2. Herein, pre-synthesized Cu-NBDC MOF （a Cu-based MOF synthesized by using 2-aminoterephthalic acid （NBDC） as ligand） is used as a precursor to anchor Cu2O/Cu on nitrogen doped porous carbon （Cu2O/Cu@NC） by annealing at different temperatures. XPS analysis shows that the Cu-N content in Cu2O/Cu@NC decreases with increasing annealing temperature. Investigation of the ECR-CO2 reveals that Cu2O/Cu@NC can inhibit the HER more effectively compared to Cu2O/Cu@C, thereby improving the overall catalytic activity and multi-electron product selectivity of the ECR-CO2. While the Faradic efficiency of formate （FEformate） increases with increasing temperature, those of ethylene and methane （FEC2H4 and FECH4, respectively） decreases with increasing temperature. Specifically, upon annealing at 400 degrees C, the CO2 Faradic efficiency of Cu2O/Cu@NC-400 is higher than 86% （-1.4 to -1.6 V vs. RHE）, including 20.4% of FEC2H4 （-1.4 V vs. RHE） and 23.9% of FECH4 （-1.6 V vs. RHE）. By contrast, FECH4 （-1.6 V vs. RHE） in the presence of Cu2O/Cu@C-400 without nitrogen doping is only 2.33%, and no C2H4 is detected. These significant differences in the catalytic behavior can be attributed to the fact that Cu-N is conducive for the stable adsorption of the *CH2 intermediate during the ECR-CO2, inhibiting the evolution of H-2. These results indicate that the pathway of the ECR-CO2 and its performance can be effectivel regulated by complexing nitrogen with Cu motifs. Doi:10.3866_PKU.WHXB202006017"}

Among the different actions proposed for mitigation of CO2 emissions, electrocatalytic reduction appears as a very promising technology for recycling CO2 to synthetic fuels and other valuable products. One of the most important challenges of this technology is the development of catalysts that allow obtaining high efficiencies in the reduction of the CO2 molecule. This work is focused in the development of Cu based nanostructured catalysts deposited on carbon supports. Supercritical fluid deposition （SFD） technique has been used for the copper deposition on three different carbon supports: carbon black （CB）, carbon nanotubes （CNT） and reduced graphene oxide （rGO）. SFD is an environmentally friendly technology that has demonstrated good results in the synthesis of nanomaterials. Results obtained in this work show that SFD technique allows a homogeneous deposition of copper nanoparticles on the different carbon supports used with deposition yields close to 90%. The average size of copper nanoparticles formed is between 13 and 19 nm. The activity of these catalysts （Cu/CB, Cu/CNT and Cu/rGO） in the electrocatalytic reduction of carbon dioxide has been carried out in gas phase in a PEM type electrochemical cell. Results show a higher CO2 conversion rate （around 40%） when using Cu/CNT catalyst. In every case, CO, formic acid and methane are the main reaction products obtained from the CO2 reduction. Nevertheless, Cu/CNT and Cu/CB catalysts promote the formation of CO, whereas formic acid is the main reaction product with Cu/rGO. This could be attributed to the presence of oxygenated groups observed in the rGO based catalyst. These results point out that the interaction between the copper nanoparticles and the carbon support plays an important role in the CO2 electrocatalytic reduction process.

However, combustion of nonrenewable resources leads to the release of large quantities of CO2, the primary greenhouse gas. Notably, the concentration of CO2 in the atmosphere is increasing annually at an astounding rate. Electrochemical CO2 reduction （ECR） to value-added fuels and chemicals using electricity from intermittent renewable energy sources is a carbon-neutral method to alleviate anthropogenic CO2 emissions. Despite the steady progress in the selective generation of C-1 products （CO and formic acid）, the production of multi-carbon species still suffers from low selectivity and efficiency. As an ECR product, ethylene （C2H4） has a higher energy density than do C-1 species and is an important industrial feedstock in high demand. However, the conversion of CO2 to C2H4 is plagued by low productivity and large overpotential, in addition to the severe competing hydrogen evolution reaction （HER） during the ECR. To address these issues, the design and development of advanced electrocatalysts are critical. Here, we demonstrate fine-tuning of ECR to C（2）H（4 ）by taking advantage of the prominent interaction of Cu with shape-controlled CeO2 nanocrystals, that is, cubes, rods, and octahedra predominantly covered with （100）, （110）, and （111） surfaces, respectively. We found that the selectivity and activity of the ECR depended strongly on the exposed crystal facets of CeO2. The overall ECR Faradaic efficiency （FE） over Cu/CeO2（110） （FE approximate to 56.7%） surpassed that of both Cu/CeO2（100） （FE approximate to 51.5%） and Cu/CeO2（111） （FE approximate to 48.4%） in 0.1 mol.L--（1） KHCO3 solutions with an H-type cell. This was in stark contrast to the exclusive occurrence of the HER over pure carbon paper, CeO2（100）, CeO2（110）, and CeO2（111）. In particular, the FE toward C2H4 formation and the partial current density increased in the sequence Cu/CeO2（111） < Cu/CeO2（100） < Cu/CeO2（110） within applied bias potentials from -1.00 to -1.15 V （vs. the reversible hydrogen electrode）, reaching 39.1% over Cu/CeO2（110） at a mild overpotential （1.13 V）. The corresponding values for Cu/CeO2（100） and Cu/CeO2（111） were FEC2H4 approximate to 31.8% and FEC2H4 approximate to 29.6%, respectively. The C2H4 selectivity was comparable to that of many reported Cu-based electrocatalysts at similar overpotentials. Furthermore, the FE for C2H4 remained stable even after 6 h of continuous electrolysis. The superior ECR activity of Cu/CeO2（110） to yield C2H4 was attributed to the metastable （110） surface, which not only promoted the effective adsorption of CO2 but also remarkably stabilized Cusp, thereby boosting the ECR to produce C2H4. This work offers an alternative strategy to enhance the ECR efficiency by crystal facet engineering. Doi:10.3866_PKU.WHXB202009023"}

By varying the pyridinic N content, highly selective production of multicarbon alcohols was achieved using the Cu/NPC hybrid catalysts with a high faradaic efficiency for one pot production of multicarbon alcohols up to 73.3% at -1.05 V （vs. RHE）. The faradaic efficiency for C2H5OH and C3H7OH was 64.6% and 8.7%, respectively. The pyridinic N species were likely the CO-producing sites and together with Cu catalytic sites acted cooperatively to produce C2H5OH and C3H7OH via a two-site mechanism for efficient CO2 reduction to multicarbon alcohols. These findings provide novel guidance for the rational design of electrocatalysts and for tuning the catalytic activity and selectivity for multicarbon alcohol production from CO2.

Heteroatom-doped and/or -derived Cu as oxide-derived Cu has been investigated in context of development of a stable catalyst with high selectivity, whereas the role of heteroatoms is not yet well understood. It is not known whether heteroatoms act as a moiety of the catalyst or simply induce reconstruction of the catalyst. This work is an investigation of the role of the heteroatom in electrocatalytic CO2 reduction with a Cu electrode modified with methanethiol monolayers （MT-Cu）, which is able to distinguish the presence of heteroatom contamination originating from electrolyte or air. Controlled potential electrolysis of CO2 using an MT-Cu electrode at -1.8 V at Ag/AgCl exhibits greater selectivity for C-2 products than an unmodified polycrystalline Cu electrode （bare Cu）. On the other hand, a sulfur-modified Cu （S-Cu） electrode predominantly generates formate as a CO2 reduction product. In an investigation of the mechanism, an in situ attenuated total reflection surface-enhanced infrared absorption spectroscopy instrument is used as a powerful surface analyzer. Scanning electron microscopy, grazing-incidence wideangle X-ray scattering （GIWAXS）, and X-ray spectroscopy （XPS） are also employed in the investigation. The spectroscopic data show that reconstruction and formation of Cusp on the Cu surface occur at negative potential greater than -1.4 V vs Ag/AgCl by electrochemical reduction of methanethiol monolayers. DFT calculations are also performed under conditions close to the experimental conditions of electrical bias and aqueous electrolyte. The results indicate that a roughened surface is favorable for generating C-2 products. In addition, the Cusp moiety promotes generation of C-2 products, demonstrating that the doped heteroatom plays a crucial role in electrochemical CO2 reduction. Doi:10.1021_acscatal.0c04106"}

With La2-xCuO4-delta （L2-xC, x=0, 0.1, 0.2, and 0.3） as proof-of-concept catalysts, we demonstrate that their CER activity and selectivity （to C2sp or CH4） show either a volcano-type or an inverted volcano-type dependence on the x values, with the extreme point at x=0.1. Among them, at -1.4 V, the L1.9C delivers the optimal activity （51.3 mA cm（-2）） and selectivity （41.5 %） for C2sp, comparable to or better than those of most reported Cu-based oxides, while the L1.7C exhibits the best activity （25.1 mA cm（-2）） and selectivity （22.1 %） for CH4. Such optimized CER properties could be ascribed to the favorable merits brought by the cation-deficiency-induced oxygen vacancies and/or CuO/RP hybrids, including the facilitated adsorption/activation of key reaction species and thus the manipulated reaction pathways.
