Cu-In catalysts are one of the most intriguing in this context because of their inexpensive cost, high Faradaic efficiency in CO （FECO）, and excellent stability. However, because of the low current densities demonstrated in aqueous electrolytes, productivities have been rather low up to date. This paper shows that the morphological and interface engineering of 3D Cu/In nanocones designed by facile electrodeposition can perform very well for electrochemical carbon dioxide reduction to syngas.

However, the use of traditional fossil energy leads to high amounts of carbon dioxide emissions, causing severe greenhouse effects. This, in turn, triggers a series of environmental problems. Harnessing renewable energy such as solar energy, wind energy, and hydropower to replace the traditional energy sources is very urgent. Conversion CO2 into value-added fuels and chemicals could be a useful strategy to mitigate the current energy and environmental crisis. It is well known that Cu-based materials are good electrocatalysts for the electrochemical reduction of CO2 （ECR-CO2）. However, they suffer from some disadvantages such as high overpotential and poor selectivity and durability. Therefore, the development of copper based electrocatalysts with high activity and selectivity is essential. Metal-organic frameworks （MOFs） materials that have the advantages of large specific surface area, tunable pore size and porosity, and highly dispersed unsaturated metal centers can be used as electrocatalysts for CO2 reduction or as precursors for further preparation of catalysts with excellent performance. Through thermal decomposition in an inert atmosphere, metal ions in MOF can be transformed into metal clusters, metal oxides, or even metal mono-atoms. Meanwhile, organic ligands are carbonized into porous carbon materials. The addition of some heteroatoms such as B, N, P, and S to carbon materials has also been shown to be effective in changing the electron state and coordination structure of the catalysts. These heteroatoms combine with carbon atoms to form a new active site, denoted as M-X-C （M is the central metal ion and X is the mixed heteroatom） to enhance the catalytic activity of the ECR-CO2. Herein, pre-synthesized Cu-NBDC MOF （a Cu-based MOF synthesized by using 2-aminoterephthalic acid （NBDC） as ligand） is used as a precursor to anchor Cu2O/Cu on nitrogen doped porous carbon （Cu2O/Cu@NC） by annealing at different temperatures. XPS analysis shows that the Cu-N content in Cu2O/Cu@NC decreases with increasing annealing temperature. Investigation of the ECR-CO2 reveals that Cu2O/Cu@NC can inhibit the HER more effectively compared to Cu2O/Cu@C, thereby improving the overall catalytic activity and multi-electron product selectivity of the ECR-CO2. While the Faradic efficiency of formate （FEformate） increases with increasing temperature, those of ethylene and methane （FEC2H4 and FECH4, respectively） decreases with increasing temperature. Specifically, upon annealing at 400 degrees C, the CO2 Faradic efficiency of Cu2O/Cu@NC-400 is higher than 86% （-1.4 to -1.6 V vs. RHE）, including 20.4% of FEC2H4 （-1.4 V vs. RHE） and 23.9% of FECH4 （-1.6 V vs. RHE）. By contrast, FECH4 （-1.6 V vs. RHE） in the presence of Cu2O/Cu@C-400 without nitrogen doping is only 2.33%, and no C2H4 is detected. These significant differences in the catalytic behavior can be attributed to the fact that Cu-N is conducive for the stable adsorption of the *CH2 intermediate during the ECR-CO2, inhibiting the evolution of H-2. These results indicate that the pathway of the ECR-CO2 and its performance can be effectivel regulated by complexing nitrogen with Cu motifs. Doi:10.3866_PKU.WHXB202006017"}

With a thin layer of metallic In deposited on the surface of the Cu nanowires, the catalyst exhibits a CO Faradaic efficiency of similar to 93% at -0.6 to -0.8 V vs RHE; additionally, an unprecedented stability of 60 h is achieved. The characterization results combined with density functional theory （DFT） calculations reveal that the interface of Cu and In plays an essential role in determining the reaction pathway. The calculation results suggest that the Cu In interface enhances the adsorption strength of *COOH, a key reaction intermediate for CO production, while destabilizes the adsorption of *H, an intermediate for H-2 evolution. We believe that these findings will provide guidance on the rational design of high-performance bimetallic catalysts for CO2 electroreduction by creating the metal-metal interface structure.

However, the mechanistic understanding of this special selectivity is still an impediment.

The effect is generally attributed to the cathodic deposition of Fe and Zn impurities from the electrolyte. Herein, an experimental-theoretical study shows the existence of potentialand facet-dependent pathways for CO2 reduction to CH4 on Cu. The small-overpotential pathway deactivates the electrodes, while the large-overpotential pathway does not. Theoretical modeling traces the origin of the deactivation to *COH and *CHO, the two *CO hydrogenation products. *COH, which reduces to *C （precursor to coke）, is more stable than *CHO around the equilibrium potential, but its symmetry factor is smaller. Hence, the *COH-based coking pathway opens first until the potential is negative enough for the *CHO-based pathway to dominate. This highlights the often-neglected role of symmetry factors in electrocatalysis design and suggests that small increases in *CHO's symmetry factor can mitigate Cu deactivation.

However, the reaction selectivity is still a main drawback due to strong competition reactions at close electrode potentials. Herein, we introduced a novel three-dimensional electrode composed of mesoporous carbon-embedded copper nanoparticles that are capable of selectively producing formic acid and short-chain hydrocarbons at low overpotentials. The mesoporous electrocatalyst was synthesized from a facile and one-pot green chemistry process using bio-sourced Tannin mimosa （polymeric flavonoids） acting as both reducing agent and carbon precursor. The role of different electrode potentials on the product selectivity （methane and ethylene） was probed by on-line differential electrochemical mass spectrometry （DEMS）. During the CO2 electrolysis, chronoamperometry experiments allowed the evaluation of the electrocatalytic performance towards CO2RR with a distinguishable production of formic acid and hydrocarbons. It should be noted that methane was first detected at a potential of -0.52 V, while ethylene showed up at -0.72 V vs. RHE. Moreover, the thin-layer Cu/C ex-tannin porous electrode surface exhibited current densities ranging from 5.9 to 42.1 mA cm（-2）, which are higher than those previously reported on copper-based electrodes. This suggests that the Cu/C ex-tannin electrocatalyst surface facilitates charge and mass transfers towards accessible active sites through mesostructured carbon paths, boosting the performance for CO2RR. The Cu/C ex-tannin electrode described here may provide a promising lead for the development of effective electrocatalyst structures for scalable electrochemical CO2 reduction electrolyzers.

In the early stages of the reaction pathway, a selectivity-determining step dictates if the pathway leads to formate （a dead-end） or to CO （and on to multi-carbon products）. Therefore, controlling the adsorption of key intermediates, in order to steer the reaction pathway as desired, is critical for selective CO2 electroreduction. Alloying copper is a strategy in which the composition and electronic properties of the alloy surface can be finely tuned to alter the reaction intermediate adsorption behavior. Herein, through in situ Raman spectroscopy and density functional theory （DFT） calculations, we investigate a composition-dependent selectivity toward CO and formate during CO2 electroreduction on a range of Cu-Sn alloy catalysts. We find that the selectivity shifts from CO to formate generation as the Sn content in the alloy catalyst increases because of a shift in adsorption preference from the C-bound *COOH intermediate to the O-bound *OCHO intermediate. Theoretical DFT calculation results indicate that this selectivity shift is due to a gradual weakening of *COOH adsorption and strengthening of *OCHO that occurs with increasing Sn content. A combination of theoretical Bader charge analysis and experimental X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy revealed the origin of such transformation: upon alloying, charge is redistributed from Sn to Cu, which creates regions of localized positive charge on the Sn sites. Therefore, with increasing tin content, these localized positive sites hinder the nucleophilic attack of the CO2 carbon, making *COOH adsorption （and the CO pathway） less favorable.

For comparison, an electrocatalyst synthesized by conventional impregnation route （leading to higher size Cu NPs on o-CNTs and CuO monoclinic phase structure） was also tested. Results showed that the electrode with Cu NPs prepared by NW route was the best in terms of average current and carbon productivity, giving threefold higher formic acid and methanol production with respect to the conventionally prepared Cu/CNT sample. Moreover, C-2-C-3 products （ethanol, acetic acid, isopropanol, acetone） were obtained, showing the possibility of CeC bond formation, probably due to the interfacial catalytic sites between the small Cu NPs and CNTs.

In this manuscript, a simple and effective plasma-activated strategy is employed to synthesize a MOF-based single-atom copper catalyst. The bombardment of plasma forms abundant oxygen vacancies and significantly increases the number of low-coordinated catalytically active copper sites. Moreover, plasma treatment also creates a hierarchically porous structure, which can effectively adsorb the reactant molecules. The synergistic effect of the porous structure and low-coordinated copper sites dramatically improves the activity of CO2 electroreduction to CH4 with a maximum faradaic efficiency of 75.3%. Furthermore, the total faradaic efficiency of carbon-containing products （CO, CH4 and C2H4） can reach as high as 96.5% with a partial current density of 47.8 mA cm（-2）. Density functional theory （DFT） calculations confirm that the low-coordinated copper sites can be beneficial for the formation and further reduction of the key intermediate to CH4.

Unfortunately, the product selectivity and conversion efficiency during the CO2RR are severely limited by the unavoidable competitive hydrogen evolution reaction （HER）.

The GN/Cu2O electrode was significantly more active towards CO2 reduction showing a current density of approximately 12.2 mA/cm（2） at -1.7 V versus Ag/AgCl, which is higher than Cu2O electrode （8.4 mA/cm（2））. Gas chromatography-mass spectrometry analysis of the liquid products revealed that ethanol （-0.34 ppm） was found to be the predominant product at -0.9 V with high reasonably Faradaic efficiency up to 9.93%.

Crystalline nanosheets of this compound that show a preferential （00I） facet orientation exhibit undiminished CO2 RR activity after 16 hours with full retention of crystal structure and surface chemical speciation and no detectable corrosion. In contrast to the range of products formed on Cu metal, CuO, and Cu2O, the CO2RR on Cu3P （00I） produces mainly hydrogen and formate as the sole carbon product in KHCO3 electrolyte. Analysis of the Cu3P （00I） facet by HAADF-STEM was used to determine the surface lattice structure, while both XPS and Auger spectroscopies were used to determine the surface chemical speciation from the kinetic energies of ionized electrons. The presented analysis identifies isolated trigonal CuP3 sites on the Cu3P（00I）-Cu3P3 terminated surface and the Cu（I） oxidation state as precursor to the active catalyst. The CO2 RR selectivity to formate and the higher turnover rate for H-2 production on the （00I） facet allows a structure-activity analysis and chemical mechanism to be proposed. Formation of a surface hydride at isolated *H-CuP3 sites is proposed as the catalytic site in forming both H-2 and formate, while the long Cu-Cu separation retards forming C-C coupling products. These results disprove previously published claims of Cu（I） oxidation state as a sufficient criterion to promote CO2RR to C2sp products, show that stronger bonded hydrides, *H-CuP3 on Cu3P, favor production of the Cl product formate over all other carbon products, and predict that stronger formate binding （bidentate） is needed for CO2RR currents to compete with H-2 production. （C） 2021 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

In this work, we prepared Cu-In nanoalloys by the in situ reduction of CuInO2 and In2O3-supported Cu nanoparticles and found that the structure of these nanoalloys evolves substantially over several electrocatalytic cycles, in parallel with an increase in the activity and selectivity for CO evolution. By combining electrochemical measurements with ex situ characterization techniques, such as XRD, STEM, elemental mapping, and XPS, we show that this behavior is caused by the segregation of copper and indium in these materials, resulting in the formation of a heterogeneous nanostructure of Cu-rich cores embedded within an In（OH）（3） shell-like matrix. The evolved catalysts show high electrocatalytic performance at moderate overpotential （i.e., j（CO） > 1.5 mA cm（-2） at -0.6 V vs RHE）. We found that the removal of In（OH）（3） from these heterogeneous nanostructures decreases the performance of the evolved catalysts, particularly in terms of the selectivity toward CO, which then recovers with the reappearance of the hydroxide following the re-equilibration of the material. On the other hand, an In（OH）（3）-supported Cu catalyst exhibits a current efficiency for CO comparable to that of the evolved nanoalloys without the need for an equilibration stage, indicating that In（OH）（3） plays a crucial role in favoring the production of CO over Cu-In electrocatalysts. These findings shed light on the link between the architecture of these materials and their performance and underscore the potential of nonreducible hydroxides to act as promoters in CO2 reduction electrocatalysis.

Herein, two distinct regimes were observed: （i） for E-an = 0.9 V-RHE we obtained 10% enhanced C-2 product selectivity （FEC2H4 = 43.6% and FEC2H5 OH = 19.8%） in comparison to the potentiostatic CO2RR at -0.7 V-RHE （FEC2H4 = 40.9% and FEC2H5OH = 11%）, （ii） while for E-an = 1.2 V-RHE, high CH4 selectivity （FECH4 = 48.3% vs 1% at constant -0.7 V-RHE） was observed. Operando spectroscopy （XAS, SERS） and ex situ microscopy （SEM and TEM） measurements revealed that these differences in catalyst selectivity can be ascribed to structural modifications and local pH effects. The morphological reconstruction of the catalyst observed after pulsed electrolysis with E-an = 0.9 V-RHE, including the presence of highly defective interfaces and grain boundaries, was found to play a key role in the enhancement of the C-2 product formation. In turn, pulsed electrolysis with E-an = 1.2 V-RHE caused the consumption of OH - species near the catalyst surface, leading to an OH-poor environment favorable for CH4 production.

In this study, we have employed size-controlled （similar to 5 nm） Cu100-xZnx nanoparticles （NPs） supported on carbon to investigate the correlation between their structure and composition and catalytic performance. By tuning the concentration of Zn, a drastic increase in CH4 selectivity （similar to 70% Faradaic efficiency （F.E.）） could be achieved for Zn contents from 10 to 50, which was accompanied by a suppression of the H-2 production. Samples containing a higher Zn concentration displayed significantly lower CH4 production and an abrupt switch in the selectivity to CO. Lack of metal leaching was observed based on quasi in situ X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy （XPS）. Operando X-ray absorption fine structure （XAFS） spectroscopy measurements revealed that the alloying of Cu atoms with Zn atoms takes place under reaction conditions and plays a determining role in the product selectivity. Time -dependent XAFS analysis showed that the local structure and chemical environment around the Cu atoms continuously evolve during CO2RR for several hours. In particular, cationic Zn species initially present were found to get reduced as the reaction proceeded, leading to the formation of a CuZn alloy （brass）. The evolution of the Cu-Zn interaction with time during CO2RR was found to be responsible for the change in the selectivity from CH4 over Cu-ZnO NPs to CO over CuZn alloy NPs. This study highlights the importance of having access to in depth information on the interplay between the different atomic species in bimetallic NP electrocatalysts under operando reaction conditions in order to understand and ultimately tune their reactivity.

The atom-pair catalyst features stable Cu-1（0）-Cu-1（xsp） pair structures, with Cu-1（xsp） adsorbing H2O and the neighbouring Cu-1（0） adsorbing CO2, which thereby promotes CO2 activation. This results in a Faradaic efficiency for CO generation above 92%, with the competing hydrogen evolution reaction almost completely suppressed. Experimental characterization and density functional theory revealed that the adsorption configuration reduces the activation energy, which generates high selectivity, activity and stability under relatively low potentials.

The main factor limiting the possibilities of long-term applications of Cu-based gas diffusion electrodes （GDE） is a relatively fast drop in the catalytic activity of copper layers. One of the solutions to the catalyst stability problem may be an in situ reconstruction of the catalyst during the process. It was observed that the addition of a small amount of copper lactate to the electrolyte results in increased Faradaic efficiency for ethylene formation. Moreover, the addition of copper lactate increases the lifetime of the catalytic layer ca. two times and stabilizes the Faradaic efficiency of the electroreduction of CO2 to ethylene at ca. 30%.

In this work, surface cavity effect on C2H4 formation was investigated using Cu2O cubes: solid cubes, cavity cubes, and broken cubes, typically representing smooth surface, cavity surface, and rough surface. With respect of C2H4 selectivity, cavity cubes show the significantly enhanced faradaic efficiency （FE） of C2H4, which is 2.7 and 1.7 times higher than those for solid cubes and broken cubes respectively. Moreover, a ratio of CO produced by CO2 reduction reaction （CO2RR） converted to CH4 and C2H4 was calculated to assess the extent of CO further reduction for a catalyst. As noted, cavity cubes exhibited a highest ratio of 29.5%, in contrast with the lower ratio of 13.0% on broken cubes and 14.9% on solid cubes. Consequently, the role of surface cavity is reflected in two effects, the increased CO formation due to higher electrochemical surface area as compared to the smooth surface, and meanwhile the increased ratio of CO converted to hydrocarbons and alcohols due to porous feature as compared to the rough surface with a comparable high electrochemical active surface area （ECSA）. What's more, when applied in a flow cell reactor with a gas diffusion electrode, cavity cubes also achieved much higher C2 selectivity of 37.7% FEC2 than solid cubes and broken cubes.

The initial oxidation state of the copper on the surface significantly influences the performance of the materials in the CO2 reduction reaction （CO2RR）. On the as-prepared material surface, a high content of Cu2O improves the selectivity toward CO and consequently the catalyzed CO2RR produce a syngas with a low H-2/CO ratio, while the CuO performs poorly.

Such a strategy provides a new way of fabricating various tandem catalysts with high selectivity and efficiency for the CO2RR. Doi:10.1039_d0ra02482a"}

This work furthers previous studies concerning the potential of carbonized copper MOF-derived electrocatalysts as catalyst materials for the electrochemical reduction of CO2. Two commercial copper-decorated metal organic frameworks （MOFs）, HKUST-1 and PCN-62, pyrolyzed at variable temperatures, 400 - 800 degrees C, were coated on both metallic nickel and copper supports as inks. The electrocatalysts' potential to reduce CO2 was gauged using an electrochemical cell with both GC-TCD and GC-FID analyses. Many of the previously reported products of this reaction were formed, however, most notably, GC-FID analysis confirmed the formation of isopropanol, a product not previously reported to the best of our knowledge.

However, combustion of nonrenewable resources leads to the release of large quantities of CO2, the primary greenhouse gas. Notably, the concentration of CO2 in the atmosphere is increasing annually at an astounding rate. Electrochemical CO2 reduction （ECR） to value-added fuels and chemicals using electricity from intermittent renewable energy sources is a carbon-neutral method to alleviate anthropogenic CO2 emissions. Despite the steady progress in the selective generation of C-1 products （CO and formic acid）, the production of multi-carbon species still suffers from low selectivity and efficiency. As an ECR product, ethylene （C2H4） has a higher energy density than do C-1 species and is an important industrial feedstock in high demand. However, the conversion of CO2 to C2H4 is plagued by low productivity and large overpotential, in addition to the severe competing hydrogen evolution reaction （HER） during the ECR. To address these issues, the design and development of advanced electrocatalysts are critical. Here, we demonstrate fine-tuning of ECR to C（2）H（4 ）by taking advantage of the prominent interaction of Cu with shape-controlled CeO2 nanocrystals, that is, cubes, rods, and octahedra predominantly covered with （100）, （110）, and （111） surfaces, respectively. We found that the selectivity and activity of the ECR depended strongly on the exposed crystal facets of CeO2.

This was in stark contrast to the exclusive occurrence of the HER over pure carbon paper, CeO2（100）, CeO2（110）, and CeO2（111）. In particular, the FE toward C2H4 formation and the partial current density increased in the sequence Cu/CeO2（111） < Cu/CeO2（100） < Cu/CeO2（110） within applied bias potentials from -1.00 to -1.15 V （vs. the reversible hydrogen electrode）, reaching 39.1% over Cu/CeO2（110） at a mild overpotential （1.13 V）. The corresponding values for Cu/CeO2（100） and Cu/CeO2（111） were FEC2H4 approximate to 31.8% and FEC2H4 approximate to 29.6%, respectively. The C2H4 selectivity was comparable to that of many reported Cu-based electrocatalysts at similar overpotentials. Furthermore, the FE for C2H4 remained stable even after 6 h of continuous electrolysis. The superior ECR activity of Cu/CeO2（110） to yield C2H4 was attributed to the metastable （110） surface, which not only promoted the effective adsorption of CO2 but also remarkably stabilized Cusp, thereby boosting the ECR to produce C2H4.

The NC-Cu catalyst exhibited an ideal current density of 22 mA cm（-2） at -0.93 V versus reversible hydrogen electrode （vs. RHE） in CO2-saturated 0.5 M KHCO3 medium, with ethanol as the predominant product at -0.93 V （vs. RHE） and a maximum Faraday efficiency of 31 %. The current density of the catalyst remained almost unchanged after 20 h of electrolysis, indicating its excellent stability.

Cu nanoclusters have been predicted by theoretical calculations to improve methane selectivity. Direct electrochemical reduction of Cu-based metal-organic frameworks （MOFs） results in large-size Cu nanoparticles which favor multi-carbon products. This study concerns an electrochemical oxidation-reduction method to prepare Cu clusters from MOFs. The derived Cu clusters exhibit a faradaic efficiency of 51.2 % for CH4 with a partial current density of >150 mA cm（-2）. High-resolution microscopy, in situ X-ray absorption spectroscopy, in situ Raman spectroscopy, and a range of ex situ spectroscopies indicate that the distinctive CH4 selectivity is due to the sub-nanometer size of the derived materials, as well as stabilization of the clusters by residual ligands of the pristine MOF.

Herein, we construct a catalyst model with a sandwich-like structure composed of highly reactive metallic Cu nanosheet that is confined in thin carbon layers （denoted as C/Cu/C nanosheet）. The sandwich-like C/Cu/C nanosheet avoids the oxidation of the active site of metallic Cu at an ambient atmosphere owing to the protective coating of the carbon layer, which inhibits the surface reconstruction that occurs via the dissolution of copper oxides and redeposition of dissolved Cu ions.

We show here for the first time how a dendritic-type nano-morphology and related fractal dimension plays a crucial role in determining the selectivity for electrodes based on Cu and Fe. The electrodes, prepared by electrodeposition of Cu or Fe on metal substrates （Cu, Ti, Al, Fe, Fe-Cr-Ni alloy） or carbon-based gas diffusion layers （GDL）, were tested in a continuous flow cell at constant potential （ - 1.5 V vs. Ag/AgCl） or at the onset potential of the first cathodic peak determined by cyclic voltammetry. Results showed that the dendritic-type nano-morphology influences positively not only the activity to formic acid, but especially the selectivity to gas products （i.e. CH4 and CO） and to higher carbon-chain liquid products （i.e. ethanol, isopropanol, acetic acid） when smoother edges and denser surface sites are present. Tests at the onset potential show very high total carbon Faradaic efficiency （FE） for Fe electrodeposited on GDL and Ti （about 92-95%）. The lowest onset potential （ - 0.3 V） is observed for Cu on GDL, showing over 80% total carbon FE and almost 60% FE to formic acid. Doi:10.1016_j.jcou.2019.09.017"}

An electrochemical pre-activation forms a highly conformal amorphous In（OH）（3） overlayer with oxygen vacancy on the CuIn alloy that facilitates CO2 adsorption to promote selective CO formation suppressing competing H-2 adsorption. Thus the activated CuIn alloy nanowires catalyse electrochemical CO2 conversion to CO with high CO selectivity （> 68.2%） and high current density （ca. -3.9 mAcm（-2）） at -0.6 Vim, which represents the higher partial CO current density （ca. -2.66 mAcm（-2）） than that of previously reported CuIn alloy powders without nanostructuring.

In particular, Cu and Cu-based catalysts have exhibited the capability of converting CO2 into multicarbon fuels and chemicals in significant quantities. Here, we report a facile and cheap fabrication method for the development of an Ag-incorporated cuprous oxide （Ag-Cu2O） electrode enabling selective synthesis of ethanol via electrochemical CO2 reduction and reveal the key factor improving the ethanol （C2H5OH） selectivity. The incorporation of Ag into Cu2O leads to the suppression of hydrogen （H-2） evolution, and furthermore, by varying the elemental arrangement （phase-separated and phase-blended） of Ag and Cu, we observe that C2H5OH selectivity can be controlled. Consequently, the Faradaic efficiency for C2H5OH on phase-blended Ag-Cu2O （Ag-Cu2OPB） is 3 times higher than that of the Cu2O without Ag dopant. We propose that the electrochemical reaction behavior is not solely associated with a role of Ag dopant, carbon monoxide （CO） leading to an ethanol formation pathway over ethylene, but also the doping pattern related population of Ag-Cu biphasic boundaries relatively suppresses the H-2 evolution reaction and encourages the reaction of mobile CO generated on Ag to a residual intermediate on a Cu site.

Cu nanowires of distinct nanocrystalline and surface structures are studied comparatively to build up the structure property relationships, which are further interpreted by performing density functional theory （DFT） calculations of the reaction pathway on the various facets of Cu. A kinetic model reveals competition between CO（g） evolution and *CO poisoning depending on the electrode potential and surface structures. Open and metastable facets such as （110） and reconstructed （110） are found to be likely the active sites for the electroreduction of CO2 to CO at the low overpotentials.

The penta-twinned NWs possess a combination of ultrahigh mechanical strength, large surface-to-volume ratios and an abundance of undercoordinated adsorption sites, all desirable for CO2 electroreduction. In particular, we show that the penta-twinned Cu NWs can withstand elastic strains orders of magnitude higher than their conventional counterpart, and as a result their CO2 electroreduction activities can be significantly enhanced by elastic tensile strains. With a moderate tensile strain, the bias potential for methane production at a decent current density （2 mA cm（-2）） can be reduced by 50%. On the other hand, the competing hydrogen evolution reaction can be suppressed by the tensile strains. The presence of H at the NW surface is found to have a minor effect on CO2 electroreduction.
