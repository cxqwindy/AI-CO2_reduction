However, the poor product selectivity of this process on copper remains a critical challenge. Modification of the aqueous electrolyte/copper interface with organic thin films has emerged as a promising means for tuning the selectivity toward valuable C->= 2 hydrocarbons. Recently, it was demonstrated that the addition of N-substituted arylpyridinium derivatives to the electrolyte substantially alters the reaction selectivity (Han et al. ACS Cent. Sci. 2017, 3, 853-859). The changes in selectivity were shown to sensitively depend on the chemical structure of the added N-substituted arylpyridinium. For example, 1-(4-tolyl)pyridinium (T-Pyr) increases the Faradaic efficiency of C->= 2 products to (compared to approximate to 25% observed for the unmodified Cu/electrolyte interface), whereas 1-(4-pyridyl)pyridinium (P-Pyr) blocks the pathways to C->= 2 products. It has been demonstrated that the reduction of N-substituted arylpyridinium derivatives leads to the formation of organic thin films on Cu electrodes. However, the mechanisms by which these thin films regulate the reaction selectivity are poorly understood. Herein, using surface enhanced infrared absorption spectroscopy, we elucidate how films formed from T-Pyr and P-Pyr give rise to distinct interfacial properties that result in the observed differences in catalytic selectivity. We find that the two films alter the reactivity of the surface in two distinct ways: (1) in the presence of T-Pyr, the interfacial pH increases at moderate current densities (<5 mA cm(-2)), as evidenced by the appearance of a carbonate absorption band in the infrared spectrum of the interface. By contrast, the band of solution carbonate is comparatively small or absent in the spectra of the unmodified Cu/electrolyte contact and the corresponding interface modified by P-Pyr. Scanning electron microscopy of the modified Cu surfaces reveals that the T-Pyrand P-Pyr-derived films exhibit distinct morphologies. Taken together, these observations suggest that the film formed by T-Pyr leads to an increase in the interfacial pH by limiting the mass transport to/from the interface. Therefore, the favorable selectivity for C->= 2 products is a result of the limited proton availability at that interface. (2) In the presence of P-Pyr, the lineshape of the C equivalent to O stretch band of atop-bound CO (COatop) is markedly different from that of COatop on unmodified and T-Pyr-modified Cu electrodes. Using pyridine, we show that N-heterocycles with a lone pair on the nitrogen atom (such as P-Pyr) compete with CO for undercoordinated Cu sites. On the basis of these results, we conclude that the selective poisoning of these undercoordinated Cu sites impedes the reduction of the CO intermediate to higher order reduction products in the presence of P-Pyr. Taken together, our results explain the observed reactivity trends in terms of the altered interfacial properties in the presence of the films. Our study further implicates undercoordinated Cu sites as catalytically active sites in the reduction of CO to hydrocarbons.\nDoi:10.1021_acs.jpcc.9b08666", "label": []}

However, efficient conversion of CO2 to produce fuels remains a challenge because a proper electrocatalyst is needed to make this CO2 reduction process more selective and efficient. In this study, we prepared nanostructured tungstate-derived copper to test its application in CO2 reduction. The prepared copper tungstate (CuWO4) nanomaterials were first characterized by analytical techniques such as transmission electron microscopy, X-ray diffraction, and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy to determine the particle size, crystallinity, purity, and composition. Then, the CuWO4 nanomaterials were further investigated in an aqueous solution containing 0.1 M NaOH by electrochemical cyclic voltammetry (CV) and linear sweep voltammetry (LSV) techniques. The CO2 electroreduction experiments were carried out in 0.1 M NaOH with the presence of CO2, and the analysis of electrochemical results shows that nanostructured CuWO4 performs better in comparison with CuO-a well-known electrocatalyst for reducing CO, to nongaseous carbon-containing products such as alcohols-because of poisoning effects of adsorbed CO, or its adsorbed-reduced intermediates on hydrogen evolution reaction. Our results also show that CO2-reduction intermediates adsorbed strongly on the surface of CuWO4, which increases the overpotential for hydrogen evolution reaction on the surface of CuWO 4 by as much as 230 mV against the 70 mV for CuO, at a current density of 0.8 mA cm(-2).\nDoi:10.1021_acs.jpcc.9b07133", "label": [[508, 523, "structure control"], [621, 626, "CuMOx"], [1304, 1306, "CO"]]}

Carbonsupported Cu nanoparticles are suitable candidates for integration in the state-ofthe-art reaction interfaces, and here, we propose, synthesize, and evaluate a bifunctional Ni-N-doped-C-supported Cu electrocatalyst, in which the support possesses active sites for selective CO2 conversion to CO and Cu nanoparticles catalyze either the direct CO2 or CO reduction to hydrocarbons.

Sulfur (S)-modified Cu electrodes were reported to selectively reduce CO2 into formic acid and fully quench the original CO2 production on clean Cu surfaces, yet the actual mechanism is still unsolved. To further understand this critical issue, herein, an integrated structure-selectivity investigation on the role of sulfur upon CO2 electroreduction was carried out. DFT calculations in combination with relevant experimental observations from the literature were utilized to identify the existing forms of sulfur and their impact of the reaction selectivity of CO2 to HCOOH under realistic conditions. Interestingly, most residual sulfur atoms were found to exist in relatively unstable forms during the reaction, which plays a dominant role in altering the reaction pathway by enhancing CO2 adsorption. In turn, these strongly adsorbed CO2 stabilize the unstable sulfur, and a synergetic effect between CO2 and S is proposed.

In the current study, the crystalline and valency factors that influence the CO2R activities of OD-Cu are revisited by employing single crystal Cu(111) foils that exclude convolutions from initial morphological and crystallographic heterogeneity. We observe that the overall CO2R performance, especially the C2H4 selectivity, correlates well with the initial oxidation level of the Cu(111) foil, of which the surface oxide layer is reduced into small fragments comprising rich grain boundaries and diversely orientated facets. Nonetheless, we find that the polycrystallinity and grain boundaries of OD-Cu, in this circumstance, are not the major causes of the observed activity enhancement. Instead, a transition state between the initial oxide and the finally reduced copper phases, as well as its longevity, dictates the catalytic property of OD-Cu in electrochemical CO2 reduction.

Oxygen is at least 1.5 eV more stable on the surface than beneath it for both crystal orientations; interstitial sites are too small to accommodate oxygen. The rate of atomic oxygen diffusion from one layer below a Cu(111) surface to the surface is 5 x 10(3) s(-1). Oxygen can survive longer in deeper layers, but it does not promote CO2 adsorption there. Diffusion of subsurface oxygen is easier to the less-dense Cu(100) surface, even from lower layers (rate approximate to 1 x 10(7) s(-1)).

A key research direction for CO2RR is tuning of the product selectivity to desired fuels while suppressing the undesired hydrogen-evolving side reaction. In this work, we employed a CuAgHg multimetallic thin-film catalyst for CO2RR. By incorporation of Hg atoms, we attempted to minimize the surface-adsorbed hydrogen atoms during CO2RR, thereby minimizing hydrogen evolution. In situ electrochemical surface interrogation along with vibrational spectroscopy revealed that Hg incorporation led to significantly suppressed surface adsorption of hydrogen atoms, as well as increased surface concentration of the intermediate CO, which is in competitive binding with protons. The two effects combined led to an ethanol-selective CO2RR catalyst; with the optimum composition, the CuAgHg electrode produced 32% ethanol and 41% C-2 (ethanol + ethylene) products, comparable to those of the best catalysts reported.

Here, we studied the relationship between the catalytic activity of bimetallic Cu-Sn catalysts with their composition and geometry through the fabrication of three-dimensional hierarchical (3D-h) Cu nanostructure and the solution-based coating of Sn nanoparticles (NPs). As the coating time of Sn NPs was increased from 1 to 60 s, Sn NPs with a larger size and a higher surface density were coated onto the 3D-h Cu, thus the surface atomic ratio of Cu/Sn gradually decreased. This compositional change in bimetallic Cu-Sn catalysts remarkably shifted the faradaic efficiency (FE) of carbon monoxide (CO) from 90.0 to 23.4% at -0.6 V-RHE.

The alcohol selectivity of the different Cu2O NPs followed the order of Cu2O-t < Cu2O-u < Cu2O-c < Cu2O-o (with the total Faradaic efficiencies of alcohol products of 10.7, 25.0, 26.2, and 35.4%). The facet-dependent effects were associated with the varied concentrations of oxygen-vacancy defects, different energy barriers of CO2 reduction, and distinct Cu-O bond lengths over the different crystal facets. The desired Cu2O-o catalyst exhibited good reduction activity with the highest partial current density of 0.51 mA/cm(2) for alcohols. The Faradaic efficiencies of alcohol products were 4.9% for methanol, 17.9% for ethanol, and 12.6% for isopropanol. The good electrochemical CO2 reduction performance was also associated with the surface reconstruction of Cu2O, which endowed the catalyst with abundant Cu-0 and Cu+ sites for promoted CO2 activation and stabilized CO* adsorption for enhanced C-C coupling. This work will provide a new route for enhancing the alcohol selectivity of nanostructured Cu2O catalysts by crystal facet engineering.\nDoi:10.1021_acsami.1c03850", "label": [[19, 24, "CuOx"], [24, 39, "structure control"], [1781, 1788, "C2H5OH"], [1771, 1775, "Faradaic efficiency"]]}

Herein, we demonstrate highly selective production of formate through CO2RR from a CO2-saturated aqueous bicarbonate solution using a porous In55Cu45 alloy as the electrocatalyst. This novel high-surface-area material was produced by means of an electrodeposition process utilizing the dynamic hydrogen bubble template approach. Faradaic efficiencies (FEs) of formate production (FEformate) never fell below 90% within a relatively broad potential window of approximately 400 mV, ranging from - 0.8 to -1.2 V vs the reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE). A maximum FEformate of 96.8%, corresponding to a partial current density of j(formate) = -8.9 mA cm(-2), was yielded at -1.0 V vs RHE. The experimental findings suggested a CO2RR mechanism involving stabilization of the HCOO* intermediate on the In55Cu45 alloy surface in combination with effective suppression of the parasitic hydrogen evolution reaction. What makes this CO2RR alloy catalyst particularly valuable is its stability against degradation and chemical poisoning. An almost constant formate efficiency of similar to 94% was maintained in an extended 30 h electrolysis experiment, whereas pure In film catalysts (the reference benchmark system) showed a pronounced decrease in formate efficiency from 82% to 50% under similar experimental conditions. The identical location scanning electron microscopy approach was applied to demonstrate the structural stability of the applied In55Cu45 alloy foam catalysts at various length scales. We demonstrate that the proposed catalyst concept could be transferred to technically relevant support materials (e.g., carbon cloth gas diffusion electrode) without altering its excellent figures of merit.\nDoi:10.1021_acsami.1c07829", "label": [[95, 103, "HCOOH"], [124, 133, "Cu-M"], [1058, 1168, "Faradaic efficiency"], [667, 699, "structure control"]]}

But most metals used for electrocatalysis are either endangered or at serious risk of limitation to their future supply. Here, we demonstrate a combined strategy for repurposing of a waste industrial Cu-Sn bronze as a catalyst material precursor and its application toward CO2 reuse. By a simple electrochemical transfer method, waste bronzes with composition Cu14Sn were anodically dissolved and cathodically redeposited under dynamic hydrogen bubble template conditions to yield mesoporous foams with Cu10Sn surface composition. The bimetal foam electrodes exhibited high CO2 electroreduction selectivity toward CO, achieving greater than 85% faradaic efficiency accompanied by a considerable suppression of the competing H-2 evolution reaction.

Tandem catalysis approaches are attractive for providing the product selectivity, which would be required for commercial applications. Here, we demonstrate a two-step tandem electrocatalytic E-CO2R with efficient conversion of the intermediate species. The catalyst scaffold is Si(100), which is etched to form a textured surface consisting of micron-sized pyramid structures with the {111} facets. Two metals are used in the electrocatalytic cascade: Ag is employed to perform a two-electron reduction of CO2 to the intermediate CO, and Cu performs conversion to more reduced products. Using high-angle physical vapor deposition, we form separated, micron-scale areas of the two electrocatalysts on opposite sides of the pyramids, with their relative surface coverages being tunable with the deposition angle. Compared to the textured scaffolds with blanket Ag and Cu used as controls, bimetallic pyramid tandem catalysts have higher current densities and much lower faradic efficiencies (FE) for CO. These effects are due to efficient conversion of the CO formed on Ag to more reduced products on Cu. Methane is the main product to be enhanced by the cascade pathway: a bimetallic catalyst with approximately equal coverages of Ag and Cu produces methane with a FE of 62% at -1.1 V-RHE, corresponding to a partial current density of 12.7 mA cm(-2).

Here, we investigate the impact of atomic-scale bimetallic effects on the electrochemical CO2 reduction performance of Cu-based catalysts by leveraging a systematic approach that unifies protocols for materials synthesis and testing and enables accurate comparisons of intrinsic catalytic activity and selectivity. We used the same physical vapor deposition method to epitaxially grow Cu(100) films decorated with a small amount of noble or base metal atoms and a combination of experimental characterization and first-principles calculations to evaluate their physicochemical and catalytic properties. The results indicate that the metal atoms segregate to under-coordinated Cu sites during physical vapor deposition, suppressing CO reduction to oxygenates and hydrocarbons and promoting competing pathways to CO, formate, and hydrogen. Leveraging these insights, we rationalize bimetallic design principles to improve catalytic selectivity for CO2 reduction to CO, formate, oxygenates, or hydrocarbons. Our study provides one of the most extensive studies on Cu bimetallics for CO2 reduction, establishing a systematic approach that is broadly applicable to research in catalyst discovery.\nDoi:10.1021_acsami.1c09128", "label": []}

A strategy is to apply the hydrophobically molecular-modified electrodes. However, the molecular-scale catalytic process remains poorly understood. Using alkanethiol-modified hydrophobic Cu as an electrode and CO2-saturated KHCO3 as an electrolyte, we reveal that H2O, rather than HCO3-, is the major H+ source for the HER, determined by differential electrochemical mass spectrometry with isotopic labeling. As a result, using in situ Raman, we find that the hydrophobic molecules screen the cathodic electric field effect on the reorientation of interfacial H2O to a \"H-down\" configuration toward Cu surfaces that corresponds to the decreased content of H-bonding-free water, leading to unfavorable H2O dissociation and thus decreased H+ source for the HER. Further, density functional theory calculations suggest that the absorbed alkanethiol molecules alter the electronic structure of Cu sites, thus decreasing the formation energy barrier of CO2RR intermediates, which consequently increases the CO2RR selectivity. This work provides a molecular-level understanding of improved CO2RR on hydrophobically molecule-modified catalysts and presents general references for catalytic systems having H2O-involved competitive HER.\nDoi:10.1021_acsami.1c13529", "label": []}

Initially the synthesis of CuInS2 nanofibers was carried out by adaptable electrospinning technique. To reduce the imperfection in the crystalline fiber, polyacrylonitrile (PAN) was selected as template polymer. Afterward, the desired chemical structure of nanofibers was achieved through sulfurization process. Making continuous CuInS2 nanofibers on the cathode surface by the electrospinning method brings the advantages of being economical, environmentally safe, and versatile. The obtained nanofibers of well investigated size and diameter according to the SEM (scanning electron microscope) were used in electrochemical studies. An improvement of Faradaic efficiency was achieved with the catalytic active CuInS2 in nanofibrous structure as compared to the solution processed CuInS2. This underlines the important effect of the electrode fabrication on the catalytic performance. Being less contaminated as compared to solution processing, and having a well-defined composition and increased catalytically active area, the CuInS2 nanofiber electrodes prepared by the electrospinning technique show a 4 times higher Faradaic efficiency.

To overcome the sintering-induced decay in the oxygen carrying capacity of unsupported Cu foams, Al2O3 films of different thicknesses (0.1-25 nm) are deposited onto the Cu foams via atomic layer deposition (ALD).

The uniform planar morphology served as a platform to evaluate the electronic effect isolated from morphological effects while minimizing geometric contributions. The catalytic selectivity and activity of Au-Cu alloys was found to be correlated with the variation of electronic structure that was varied with tunable composition. Notably, the d-band center gradually shifted away from the Fermi level with increasing Au atomic ratio, leading to a weakened binding energy of *CO, which is consistent with low CO coverage observed in CO stripping experiments. The decrease in the *CO binding strength results in the enhanced catalytic activity for CO formation with the increase in Au content. In addition, it was observed that copper oxide/hydroxide species are less stable on Au-Cu surfaces compared to those on the pure Cu surface, where the surface oxophilicity could be critical to tuning the binding strength of *OCHO. These results imply that the altered electronic structure could explain the decreased formation of HCOO- on the Au-Cu alloys. In general, the formation of CO and HCOO- as main CO2 reduction products on planar Au-Cu alloys followed the shift of the d-band center, which indicates that the electronic effect is the major governing factor for the electrocatalytic activity of CO2 reduction on Au-Cu bimetallic thin films.\nDoi:10.1021_acsami.9b01553", "label": [[61, 66, "Cu-M"], [536, 543, "alloy"], [1403, 1406, "CO"]]}

In this work, porous silver filtration membranes are demonstrated as simple and efficient gas-diffusion electrodes for CO2 reduction to CO at high current densities in an MEA-type device. A partial current density for CO of up to ca. 200 mA cm(-2) was achieved at a cell voltage of ca. 3.3 V, in tandem with minimal H-2 production. However, the analysis of cathodic and anodic outlet streams revealed that CO2 cross-over across the anion-exchange membranes, mostly in the form of CO32- but partially as HCOO- generated over the cathode, actually exceeds the amount of CO2 converted to the target product, resulting in a poor utilization of the reactant and in the early onset of mass transfer limitations. In addition, CO2 cross-over leads to a nonstoichiometric decrease of the outlet flow rate from the cathodic compartment. This effect can lead to a substantial overestimation of catalytic performance if the inlet flow rate of CO2 is used as reference for calculating partial current densities and Faradaic efficiencies. The results of this work highlight the importance of carrying out a carbon balance, in addition to traditional measurements of activity and selectivity, to adequately assess the performance of CO2 reduction devices at high current densities, and inform future efforts aimed at mitigating membrane cross-over in MEA-type electrolyzers for CO2 reduction.\nDoi:10.1021_acsami.9b13081", "label": []}

In this work, bismuth (Bi)-doped SnO nanosheets were grown on copper foam (Bi-SnO/Cu foam) by a one-step hydrothermal reaction method and applied for the electrochemical reduction of CO2 to formic acid (HCOOH). The experimental results indicated that Bi doping stabilized the divalent tin (Sn2+) existing on the surface of the electrocatalyst, making it difficult to be reduced to metallic tin (Sn-0) during the electrochemical reduction process. In addition, combining with density functional theory (DFT) calculations, it is found that Bi doping and electron transfer from the catalyst to the Cu foam substrate could enhance the adsorption of *OOCH intermediates. As such, the Bi-doped SnO electrocatalyst exhibited a superior faradaic efficiency of 93% at -1.7 V (vs Ag/AgCl) for the reduction of CO2 to HCOOH, together with a current density of 12 mA cm(-2) and excellent stability in at least 30 h of operation.\nDoi:10.1021_acsami.9b13270", "label": []}

Although copper (Cu)-based catalysts produce hydrocarbons with relatively high selectivity during CO2 electroreduction, such catalysts evolve a certain amount of H-2 via proton reduction reactions. Because low-coordinated Cu sites are likely active for the competing hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), hindering such low-coordinated Cu sites by decoration with inert metal atoms is a promising approach to increasing the selectivity of the CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR) over the HER. In the present study, we synthesized tin (Sn)-modified Cu nanoparticles with varied Sn ratios via a simple wet-chemical method. Physical and theoretical characterizations revealed that Sn atoms preferentially locate at the low-coordinated sites when Sn is present at low contents (less than 1.5%). Compared with the bare Cu catalyst, the Sn-modified Cu electrocatalyst shows suppression of the HER and acceleration of the carbon monoxide (CO) evolution reaction. The first-principles calculations about the adsorption strength of reaction intermediates revealed that low-coordinated Cu sites with the modification of Sn atoms exhibited lower activity for both HER and CO2RR than that without modification. As a result, the activity of coordinatively saturated Cu atoms, where the CO2RR is more favorable than the HER, was emphasized. The modification of trace foreign metals in metal nanoparticles may provide an avenue for the synthesis of selective electrocatalysts for various target reactions.\nDoi:10.1021_acsanm.1c00514", "label": [[778, 794, "Cu-M"], [922, 981, "surface/interface modification"], [1176, 1178, "CO"]]}

By using cyclic voltammetry, transitions in the composition of dissolved and surface-adsorbed species could be identified. At a highly negative potential [more negative than -1.2 V (vs RHE)], the formation of OD- and D-2 is dominant, resulting in a relatively high concentration of dissolved carbonate, with a maximum IR intensity at , similar to 1410 cm(-1). When the potential is less negative than -1.2 V, spectroscopically resolved interconversion of carbonate (CO32-) to bicarbonate (D)CO(3)(- )is evident, explained by a decrease in the local pH. Furthermore, adsorbed carbonate can now be distinguished from dissolved carbonate due to the strongly potential-dependent peak position of adsorbed carbonate ranging from similar to 1510 to 1570 cm(-1). In the potential range of -1.2 to -0.5 V (vs RHE), using D2O, the recently proposed CO2-dimerradical-anion was observed, adsorbed on the polycrystalline copper film. We also assign a previously unresolved band at similar to 1610 cm(-1) to this species. The dimer disproportionates to adsorbed CO and CO32-, the latter being converted to bicarbonate by proton addition. Adsorbed CO is sensitive to a Stark shift, that is, a shift as a function of applied potential. Eventually, CO disappears, and the infrared signature of (dissolved) formate at similar to 1590 cm(-1) appears at similar to -0.5 V. We discuss the spectra and chemistry in detail, based on the reference spectra of carbonate, bicarbonate, and formate and using (CO2)-C-13 to substantiate the formation of the dimer intermediate.

The catalyst is a Cu film sputtered onto the surface of a PTFE membrane, through which the products of CO2 reduction are sampled for analysis by differential electrochemical mass spectroscopy (DEMS). To avoid changes in the catalyst morphology, the cathode potential is set at -0.8 V vs RHE and -1.15 V vs RHE. We find that the faradaic efficiency (FE) for hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) minimizes and that for the carbon dioxide reduction reaction (CO2RR) maximizes when the durations at each potential are 10 s. Under these conditions, the FE for the HER decreases to 11%, relative to 22% for static electrolysis, at -1.15 V vs RHE, and the FE for the CO2RR increases to 89%, relative to 78% for static electrolysis. Pulsed electrolysis also increases the FE for C2+ products from 68% for static electrolysis to 81%. Temporal analysis of the products by DEMS reveals that while the variation in product concentrations near the cathode begins in synchrony at the start of pulsed electrolysis, the concentration of C2H4 increases and those of CO and H-2 decrease with extended time. We attribute these trends to an increase in the ratio of adsorbed CO to H on the catalyst surface. Simulation of pulsed electrolysis also shows that during the period when the cathode is at -0.8 V vs RHE, the local concentration of CO2 in the electrolyte near the cathode builds up. This inventory then allows electrolysis during the period at -1.15 V vs RHE to occur with a higher CO2 concentration than could be achieved for static electrolysis. The net effect of alternating cathode potentials is to enhance the local concentration of CO2, which favors the progress of the CO2RR relative to the HER and in particular the formation of C2+ products.\nDoi:10.1021_acscatal.0c02915", "label": []}

Using advanced spectroscopy, electron microscopy, and electrochemically active surface area characterization techniques, the electronic structure and the changes in the morphology/roughness of thermally oxidized copper thin films were revealed during CO2RR. For this purpose, we developed an in situ cell for X-ray spectroscopy that could be operated accurately in the presence of gases or liquids to clarify the role of the initial thermal oxide phase and its active phase during the electrocatalytic reduction of CO2. It was found that the Cu(I) species formed during the thermal treatment are readily reduced to Cu-0 during the CO2RR, whereas Cu(II) species are hardly reduced. In addition, Cu(II) oxide electrode dissolution was found to yield a porous/void structure, where the lack of electrical connection between isolated islands prohibits the CO2RR. Therefore, the active/stable phase for CO2RR is metallic copper, independent of its initial phase, with a significant change in its morphology upon its reduction yielding the formation of a rougher surface with a higher number of underco-ordinated sites. Thus, the initial thermal oxidation of copper in air controls the reaction activity/selectivity because of the changes induced in the electrode surface morphology/roughness and the presence of more undercoordinated sites during the CO2RR.\nDoi:10.1021_acscatal.0c03484", "label": []}

The ligand exchange and removal was evidenced by infrared spectroscopy (ATR-FTIR) analysis, whereas high-resolution scanning transmission electron microscopy (HAADF-STEM) showed their effect on the interparticle distance and nanoparticle rearrangement. Later on, we developed a process-on-substrate method to track these effects on CO2R. Cu-Ag (OAm) gave a lower on-set potential for hydrocarbon production, whereas Cu-Ag (MIPA) and Cu-Ag (NaBH4) promoted syngas production. The electrochemical impedance and surface area analysis on the well-controlled electrodes showed gradual increases in the electrical conductivity and active surface area after each surface treatment.

It is not known whether heteroatoms act as a moiety of the catalyst or simply induce reconstruction of the catalyst. This work is an investigation of the role of the heteroatom in electrocatalytic CO2 reduction with a Cu electrode modified with methanethiol monolayers (MT-Cu), which is able to distinguish the presence of heteroatom contamination originating from electrolyte or air. Controlled potential electrolysis of CO2 using an MT-Cu electrode at -1.8 V at Ag/AgCl exhibits greater selectivity for C-2 products than an unmodified polycrystalline Cu electrode (bare Cu). On the other hand, a sulfur-modified Cu (S-Cu) electrode predominantly generates formate as a CO2 reduction product. In an investigation of the mechanism, an in situ attenuated total reflection surface-enhanced infrared absorption spectroscopy instrument is used as a powerful surface analyzer. Scanning electron microscopy, grazing-incidence wideangle X-ray scattering (GIWAXS), and X-ray spectroscopy (XPS) are also employed in the investigation.

Here, we demonstrate the substantial influence of tensile strain on the selectivity of CO2 reduction toward higher value-added, multicarbon products by modulating the residual mismatch strain of Cu(001) thin film catalysts grown epitaxially on single-crystal Si substrates. By decreasing film thickness from 100 to 20 nm, up to 0.22% tensile strain is introduced in-plane, shifting the measured Cu d-band center at the surface upward, in good agreement with theory. CO2 electrolysis at moderate overpotential (-0.9 V vs reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE)) in 0.1 M KHCO3 electrolyte reveals that the shift in d-band center results in the suppression of single-carbon products, while activity for multicarbon products is maintained. Examination of the ratio of partial current densities for multicarbon products relative to CO and CH4 suggests increased CO insertion and hydrogenation on the tensile-strained Cu(001) surface, driven by a change in the adsorbate bonding because of an increased interaction with the upshifted d-band. This work provides direct experimental evidence on model thin film CO2 catalysts that strain can be systematically manipulated as a valuable tool, independent of catalyst composition, for the design of efficient CO2 electrocatalysts toward energy-dense products.\nDoi:10.1021_acscatal.0c05671", "label": [[54, 56, "Cu"], [932, 953, "C2+"], [1355, 1414, "structure control"]]}

In this work, both acetaldehyde and propionaldehyde were electrochemically reduced on a Cu catalyst to illustrate that it is a viable pathway to ethanol and 1-propanol, respectively, supporting the mechanistic route previously proposed in the literature. Also noteworthy is that the electroreduction of acetaldehyde to ethanol is selective on Cu and does not occur on a catalyst such as Au. C-13 and H-1 NMR analysis on isotopically labeled acetaldehyde was utilized to trace the reduction process. Experimental observations were also supported with DFT calculations, indicating a higher-energy reaction intermediate on Au(111) over Cu(100). In an aqueous solution, acetaldehyde is at equilibrium with ethanediol, and propionaldehyde with propanediol. DFT calculations suggest that acetaldehyde, not ethanediol, is more likely to be reduced to ethanol. The dissociation of adsorbed ethanediol to acetaldehyde and water was also found to be favorable on both Cu and Au surfaces. In summary, the results from this study support previously proposed mechanisms and provide a framework for testing other stable CO2 reaction intermediates to gain insights into the overall CO2 reaction pathway.\nDoi:10.1021_acscatal.0c05615", "label": []}

In this joint experimental-computational work, we exploit structural sensitivity effects to elucidate the ethanol-producing active sites on Cu-Ag CO2RR tandem catalysts. Specifically, methane-selective Cu nano-octahedra (Cu-oh), enclosed by (111) facets, and ethylene-selective Cu nanocubes (Cu-cub), enclosed by (100) facets, are mixed with CO-selective Ag nanospheres (Ag-sph) to form Cu-oh-(A)g and Cu-cub-Ag bimetallic catalysts. Ethanol is selectively enhanced via the *CHx-*CO coupling pathway at the terraces of Cuoh-Ag in the CO-enriched environment generated by the Ag-sph. Conversely, on Cu-cub-Ag, ethanol is selectively produced via the same pathway at the edges and corners of Cu-cub, while ethylene continues to be produced at the terraces. The terraces being the predominant surfaces on the catalysts, such facet dependence explains the higher ethanol-to-ethylene ratio on the Cuoh-Ag. These findings illustrate how tandem catalysis and structure-sensitive effects can be combined to obtain notable changes in the selectivity of electrochemical reactions.\nDoi:10.1021_acscatal.1c00420", "label": [[78, 86, "C2H5OH"], [89, 94, "Cu-M"], [21, 49, "structure control"]]}

In this work, we develop a facile galvanic displacement protocol, involving an electropolished Cu sheet in a mixed Sb(III)-Cl- precursor solution, to form an Sb-modified Cu electrode that can selectively convert CO2 to CO with a Faradaic efficiency of ca. 82% and an undecayed reduction current over 12 h. Moreover, in situ infrared spectroscopy detects a relatively weak and red-shifted CO band on the Sb-modified Cu electrode as compared to that on the Cu electrode at potentials of CO2RR. Density functional theory calculations reveal that the Sb clusters on the Cu surface change the electronic structures of Cu as well as Sb and thus weaken the CO binding strength on Cu sites, consistent with the observed CO band feature and high CO selectivity.

Here, with ab initio molecular dynamics simulation and free-energy sampling technology, the key step in producing C-2 species, that is, CO dimerization to OCCO, was studied over Cu with an explicit solvent comprising Li+, K+, or Cs+. Results show that the free-energy barriers and reaction free energies of CO dimerization decrease in the presence of larger cations. Detailed analyses revealed that the dynamic cation intermediate complex is crucial for the promotion of C-2 formation because larger cations can interact with two CO simultaneously, facilitating C-C bond formation.

However, the highly selective generation of multicarbon products remains a challenge, suffering from poor mechanistic understanding. Herein, we used operando Raman spectroscopy to track the potential-dependent reduction of Cu2O nanocubes and the surface coverage of reaction intermediates. In particular, we discovered that the potential-dependent intensity ratio of the Cu-CO stretching band to the CO rotation band follows a volcano trend similar to the CO2RR Faradaic efficiency for multicarbon products. By combining operando spectroscopic insights with Density Functional Theory, we proved that this ratio is determined by the CO coverage and that a direct correlation exists between the potential-dependent CO coverage, the preferred C-C coupling configuration, and the selectivity to C2+, products.

In this study, we investigate the stability of a model catalyst system consisting of CuOx nanoparticles selectively deposited on TiO2 nanoparticles on a highly oriented pyrolytic graphite (HOPG) substrate under electrochemical CO2 reduction conditions. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) was used to study changes in the chemical composition and approximate amount of the nanoparticles after electrochemical reduction. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) was used to track the structure and movement of specific particles after electrochemical reduction, and atomic force microscopy (AFM) was used to monitor morphological changes on the substrate surface. Herein, we show that sufficiently reducing potentials lead to mobility of some (approximately 30%) of the TiO2 nanoparticles. The TiO2 nanoparticle mobility results in some agglomeration and vertical growth of the nanoparticles, as the mobile nanoparticles tend to attach to the top of the stationary particles. It is also shown that, upon agglomeration, the mobile TiO2 nanoparticles undergo a reduction in diameter, while the diameter of the stationary particles remains unchanged.

The comprehensive mechanism includes all possible pathways that were established by accounting for solvent-intermediate interactions, structural energy variations due to water dynamics, and unguaranteed global minimum structures in explicit solvent models, resulting in several favorable alternative pathways. Due to the similarity of the ethylene and ethanol distribution and the overpotentials obtained from CO2 electroreduction and CO electroreduction on the Cu(100) surface, in this work, the CO2 to CO reduction step was excluded, and the presented mechanisms began with the CO adsorption step. The results suggest that *CO-*CO coupling is the most kinetically favored type of coupling. However, when the *CO concentration increases, the C-C coupling step can be altered to *CO-*CHO or *CO-*COH coupling and be more kinetically inhibited. The dissociation of the C-O bond is important because it can separate the pathways leading toward ethylene, and it was found to be substantially favored with intermediates in which the carbon atom binding to the oxygen atom is fully hydrogenated. The breaking of the C-O bond in a very late intermediate, that is, *CH2CH2OH, is feasible, which may create a major challenge to tune the selectivity toward ethylene or ethanol. The bifurcation of the ethylene and ethanol pathways occurs at late protonation steps, and the key intermediates that separate the pathways were identified. Furthermore, this work provides theoretical insights into how water affects the energy barriers of C-C coupling, C-O bond dissociation, and the stability of key intermediates. The results offer a comprehensive mechanism that provides guidance on tuning ethylene and ethanol selectivity and an in-depth understanding of the solvent effect on the intermediate species involved in CO2 electroreduction.\nDoi:10.1021_acscatal.1c01486", "label": []}

However, recent studies have shown that these materials can contain significant levels of metallic impurities that can dramatically alter their electrochemical properties. Here, the electrocatalytic activity of pure graphite (PG), graphene oxide (GO), and carbon nanotubes (CNT) dispersed on glassy carbon (GC) are investigated for the electrochemical CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR) in aqueous solution. It was observed that GO and CNT dispersed on GC all exhibit significant electrochemical activity that can be ascribed to impurities of Ni, Fe, Mn, and Cu. The level of Cu in GO can be particularly high and is the cause for the appearance of methane in the products produced over this material when it is used for the CO2RR. Washing these supports in ultrapure nitric acid is effective in removing the metal impurities and results in a reduction in the electrochemical activity of these forms of carbon. In particular, for GO, nearly all of the catalytically relevant metals can be removed. Electrochemical deposition of Cu on GO and PG supported on GC, and on GC itself, increased both the electrochemical activity of these materials and the production of methane via the CO2RR Particularly high rates of methane formation per unit of Cu mass were obtained for Cu electrodeposited on GO and PG supported on GC. We suggest that this high activity may be due to the preferential deposition of Cu onto defects present in the graphene sheets comprising these materials.\nDoi:10.1021_acscatal.5b02399", "label": []}

We used density functional theory (DFT) to evaluate the thermodynamics and kinetics of CO, reduction pathways on Cu(100) and Cu(111) with the aim of understanding the experimentally reported differences in CO2 reduction products. Results suggest that the hydrogenation of CO* to hydroxymethylidyne (COH*) or formyl (CHO*) is a key selective step. Cu(111) favors COH* formation, through which methane and ethylene are produced via a common CH, species under high oyerpotential (<-0.8 V vs RHE). On Cu(100), formation of CHO* is preferred and ethylene formation goes through C-C coupling of two CHO* species followed by a series of reduction steps of the C-2 intermediates, under relatively lower overpotential (-0.4 to -0.6 V vs RHE). Further reduction of these C-2 intermediates, however, require larger potentials (similar to-1.0 V vs RHE) and conflicts with the experimentally observed low potential pathway to C-2 products on Cu(100). Calculations show that the presence of (111) step sites on the flat (100) terrace can reduce the overpotential for C-2 production on the Cu electrode, which may be present on Cu(100) due to reconstruction. On Cu(100), a change in CO* coverage from low to high with increasing negative applied potential can trigger a switch from ethylene/ethanol to methane/ethylene as the reduction products by affecting the relative stability of CHO* and COH*.\nDoi:10.1021_acscatal.5b01967", "label": []}

Comparing the production rate and Faradaic selectivity of the major products as a function the working potential in the presence of Cl-, Br-, and I-, we show that the activity and selectivity of Cu depends on the concentration and nature of the added halide. We find that the addition Cl- and Br- results in an increased CO selectivity. On the contrary, in the presence of I- the selectivity toward CO drops down and instead methane formation is enhanced up to 6 times compared with the halide-free electrolyte. Even though Br- and I- can induce morphology changes of the surface, the modification in the catalytic performance of Cu is mainly attributed to halides adsorption on the Cu surface. We hypothesizes that the adsorption of halides alters the catalytic performance of Cu by increasing the negative charge on the surface according to the following order: Cl- < Br- < I-. In the case of adsorbed I-, the induced negative charge has a remarkably positive effect favoring the protonation of CO. These results present an easy way to enhance CH4 production during the CO2RR on Cu.

The partial current of C2 product formation was found to be higher than that of the (parasitic) hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) at any potential studied (-0.4 to 1.0 vs the reversible hydrogen electrode). Moreover, formate production could largely be suppressed at any applied potential down to efficiencies (FEformate) of <= 6%.

The cuprous oxide phase has been formed after the Cu electrodeposition step by exposing the large-surface area catalyst to air at room temperature. The superior selectivity of the Cu foam catalyst studied herein originates from a combination of two effects, the availability of specific surface sites for C C coupling [dominant (100) surface texture] and the temporal trapping of gaseous intermediates (in particular CO and C2H4) inside the mesoporous catalyst material during CO2 electrolysis.

The bimetallic electrode was prepared through the electrodeposition of Sn species on the surface of oxide-derived copper (OD-Cu). The Cu surface, when decorated with an optimal amount of Sn, resulted in a Faradaic efficiency (FE) for CO greater than 90% and a current density of -1.0 mA cm(-2) at -0.6 V vs RHE, compared to the CO FE of 63% and -2.1 mA cm(-2) for OD-Cu. Excess Sn on the surface caused H-2 evolution with a decreased current density. X-ray diffraction (XRD) suggests the formation of Cu Sn alloy. Auger electron spectroscopy of the sample surface exhibits zerovalent Cu and Sn after the electrodeposition step. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations show that replacing a single Cu atom with a Sn atom leaves the d-band orbitals mostly unperturbed, signifying no dramatic shifts in the bulk electronic structure. However, the Sn atom discomposes the multifold sites on pure Cu, disfavoring the adsorption of H and leaving the adsorption of CO relatively unperturbed. Our catalytic results along with DFT calculations indicate that the presence of Sn on reduced OD-Cu diminishes the hydrogenation capability-i.e., the selectivity toward H-2 and HCOOH-while hardly affects the CO productivity. While the pristine monometallic surfaces (both Cu and Sn) fail to selectively reduce CO2, the Cu Sn bimetallic electrocatalyst generates a surface that inhibits adsorbed H*, resulting in improved CO FE.

In this work, we prepared Cu-In nanoalloys by the in situ reduction of CuInO2 and In2O3-supported Cu nanoparticles and found that the structure of these nanoalloys evolves substantially over several electrocatalytic cycles, in parallel with an increase in the activity and selectivity for CO evolution. By combining electrochemical measurements with ex situ characterization techniques, such as XRD, STEM, elemental mapping, and XPS, we show that this behavior is caused by the segregation of copper and indium in these materials, resulting in the formation of a heterogeneous nanostructure of Cu-rich cores embedded within an In(OH)(3) shell-like matrix. The evolved catalysts show high electrocatalytic performance at moderate overpotential (i.e., j(CO) > 1.5 mA cm(-2) at -0.6 V vs RHE). We found that the removal of In(OH)(3) from these heterogeneous nanostructures decreases the performance of the evolved catalysts, particularly in terms of the selectivity toward CO, which then recovers with the reappearance of the hydroxide following the re-equilibration of the material. On the other hand, an In(OH)(3)-supported Cu catalyst exhibits a current efficiency for CO comparable to that of the evolved nanoalloys without the need for an equilibration stage, indicating that In(OH)(3) plays a crucial role in favoring the production of CO over Cu-In electrocatalysts.

Copper (Cu) and its oxides are by far the most effective electrocatalysts for this purpose. However, the formation of ethanol using these catalysts is generally less favored in comparison to that of ethylene. In this work, we demonstrate that the selectivity of CO2 reduction toward ethanol could be tuned by introducing a cocatalyst to generate an in situ source of mobile CO reactant. Cu-based oxides with different amounts of Zn dopants (Cu, Cu10Zn, Cu4Zn, and Cu2Zn) were prepared and used as catalysts under ambient pressure in aqueous 0.1 M KHCO3 electrolyte. By varying the amount of Zn in the bimetallic catalysts, we found that the selectivity of ethanol versus ethylene production, defined by the ratio of their Faradaic efficiencies (FEethanol/FEethylene), could be tuned by a factor of up to similar to 12.5. Ethanol formation was maximized on Cu4Zn at -1.05 V vs RHE, with a remarkable Faradaic efficiency and current density of 29.1% and -8.2 mA/cm(2), respectively. The Cu4Zn catalyst was also catalytically stable for the production of ethanol for at least 5 h. The importance of Zn as a CO-producing site was demonstrated by performing CO2 reduction on Cu-Ni and Cu-Ag bimetallic catalysts. Operando Raman spectroscopy revealed that the as-deposited Cu-based oxide films were reduced to the metallic state during CO2 reduction, after which only signals belonging to CO adsorbed on Cu sites were recorded. This showed that the reduction of CO2 probably occurred on metallic sites rather than on metal oxides.

However, the cause of this selectivity is not fully understood. In this work, we elucidated a fundamental g reason underlying the selectivity of CO2 reduction toward C-2 products by studying its reactivity on Cu(100), Cu(111), and Cu(110) single-crystal surfaces. A combination of cyclic and linear sweep voltammetries, chronoamperometry, online gas chromatography, H-1 nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy, and density functional theory (DFT) calculations was employed for this end. A wide range of electrochemical potentials from-0.28 to-1.25 V versus the reversible hydrogen electrode was investigated. Aqueous 0.1 M KHCO3 was used as the electrolyte. We report here two general trends on Cu2O-derived Cu and Cu single-crystal surfaces: (i) the onset potential for the formation of C2H4 always starts 300-400 mV more negative than the onset potential for CO evolution, and (ii) C2H4 was formed only after a significant amount of CO gas was produced. Among the single-crystal surfaces investigated, Cu(100) required the lowest overpotential to reduce CO, to C2H4 center dot These observations were rationalized using DFT simulations. Of the three single-crystal surfaces modeled, the dimerization of two CO* molecules on Cu(100) exhibited the lowest energy barrier, and this barrier can be further lowered with higher CO* coverages. The application of our observed experimental trends to other previously reported Cu-based systems strongly suggests that a high surface coverage of CO* is central for the selective formation of C2H4.\nDoi:10.1021_acscatal.6b03147", "label": []}

However, traditional metal electrodes suffer from higher overpotentials, low activities, and poor selectivity. In this article, the pulse electrodeposition (P-ED) method is employed to prepare a copper electrode for ERC. The P-ED method can easily create Cu coatings on carbon paper with a much rougher surface and extended surface area, which is highly beneficial for improving their activity and selectivity. As a result, the prepared Cu electrodes exhibit high faradaic efficiency (of 85% at -2.8 V) and enhanced partial current density (jCH(4) = 38 mA cm(-2)) for methane, which is by far the highest value ever reported at room temperature and ambient pressure. The enhanced activity is attributed to the extended reactive areas with rough morphology and loosened coating structure to ensure CO2 access the reaction sites located at the sublayers of the deposited Cu coatings. The prominent selectivity for CH4 is likely due to the presence of a stepped surface, which is formed by introduction of Cu (100) step into Cu (111) and Cu (220) terraces during the P-ED processes. The lower resistance to the one-electron transfer to CO2, which is a pre equilibrium step prior to the rate-limiting nonelectrochemical step, is another positive factor to improve the ERC activity for CH4. Furthermore, we surprisingly find that the activity and selectivity of the Cu electrode can be easily recovered through continuous CO2 bubbling. This paper provides a facile method to prepare highly effective electrodes for electrochemical conversion of CO2.\nDoi:10.1021_acscatal.7b00571", "label": [[75, 82, "CH4"], [6, 12, "Cu"], [798, 801, "Faradaic efficiency"], [977, 1096, "structure control"]]}

The observed product distribution as a function of alloy composition and applied potential is rationalized in terms of the relative adsorption strengths of CO and COOH intermediates at Cu and In sites and the distinct variation with applied potential induced by the differences in electronic structure.

It was observed that halide ions such as I- can induce significant nano structuring of the oxidized Cu surface, even at open circuit potential, including the formatiOn of Cu crystals with welldefined shapes. Furthermore, the presence of Cl-, Br-, and I- was found to lower the overpotential and to increase the CO2 electroreduction rate on plasma-activated preoxidized Cu catalyst in the order Cl- < Br- < I-, without sacrificing their intrinsically high C-2-C-3 product selectivity (similar to 65% total Faradaic efficiency at -1.0 V vs RHE).

These catalyst materials appear to be promising for future applications where gaseous CO2 reactants can be transported through the 3D catalyst thereby tuning the mean residence time of reaction intermediates inside the catalyst, which crucially influences the final product distribution. In particular, the annealed skeleton (300 degrees C, 12 h) and the one modified by Cu foam electrodeposition show profound activities toward C-2 product formation (C2H4, C2H6) with faradaic efficiencies reaching FEC2 = 32.3% (annealed skeleton sample, -1.1 V vs RHE) and FEC2 = 29.1% (electrodeposited sample, -1.1 V vs RHE), whereas the electropolished Cu skeleton remains largely inactive for both the C-1 and the C-2 pathway of hydrocarbon formation. This effect is discussed on the basis of residual impurities that are left behind from the investment casting approach on which the fabrication of these Cu skeleton support materials is based. In addition, a higher FEC2H4/FEC2H6 ratio is observed for the annealed Cu skeleton as compared to the electrodeposited Cu foam. Such a switching in the C-2 product distribution (FEC2H4/FEC2H6 ratio) is discussed on the basis of particular morphological effects (residence time of intermediates inside the catalyst) related to the three-dimensional nature of the used catalysts.\nDoi:10.1021_acscatal.7b01548", "label": [[841, 846, "Faradaic efficiency"], [763, 766, "C2+"], [91, 120, "structure control"], [69, 71, "Cu"]]}

In particular, Cu and Cu-based catalysts have exhibited the capability of converting CO2 into multicarbon fuels and chemicals in significant quantities. Here, we report a facile and cheap fabrication method for the development of an Ag-incorporated cuprous oxide (Ag-Cu2O) electrode enabling selective synthesis of ethanol via electrochemical CO2 reduction and reveal the key factor improving the ethanol (C2H5OH) selectivity. The incorporation of Ag into Cu2O leads to the suppression of hydrogen (H-2) evolution, and furthermore, by varying the elemental arrangement (phase-separated and phase-blended) of Ag and Cu, we observe that C2H5OH selectivity can be controlled. Consequently, the Faradaic efficiency for C2H5OH on phase-blended Ag-Cu2O (Ag-Cu2OPB) is 3 times higher than that of the Cu2O without Ag dopant. We propose that the electrochemical reaction behavior is not solely associated with a role of Ag dopant, carbon monoxide (CO) leading to an ethanol formation pathway over ethylene, but also the doping pattern related population of Ag-Cu biphasic boundaries relatively suppresses the H-2 evolution reaction and encourages the reaction of mobile CO generated on Ag to a residual intermediate on a Cu site.\nDoi:10.1021_acscatal.7b02822", "label": [[96, 103, "C2H5OH"], [1084, 1091, "M+CuOx"], [25, 45, "structure control"]]}

The initial electrodeposition of dendritic Cu activates the technical supports for highly efficient formate production at low overpotentials (FEFonnate = 49.2% at -0.7 V vs RHE) and in particular for C-C coupling reactions at higher over potentials (FEC2H4 = 34.3% at -1.1 V vs RHE). The subsequent thermal annealing treatment directs the CO2RR product selectivity toward multicarbon alcohol formation (ethanol/EtOH and n-propanol/n-PrOH) resulting into a total Faradaic yield of FEalcohol = 24.8% at-1.0 V vs RHE (FEEtOH = 13%). Moreover, the EtOH and n-PrOH production rate of 155.2 mu MLelectrolyte-1 cm(ECSA)(-2) h(-1) and 101.4 mu MLelectrolyte-1 cm(ECSA)(-2) h(-1) (normalized with respect to the electrolyte volume and the electrochemically active surface area ECSA), respectively, are the highest ones observed so far for Cu catalysts modified by a Cu2O/CuO surface precursor phases. The maximum of the n-PrOH efficiency is observed at slightly less negative potentials of -0.9 V with FEn-PrOH = 13.1%. Identical location (IL) SEM analysis was applied prior to and after the annealing preparation steps and in addition prior to and after CO2RR to monitor severe morphological changes which go along with the formation of Cu2O/CuO surface phases upon thermal annealing and their subsequent electroreduction under operando conditions of the CO2RR. Fringe pattern in the HR-TEM analysis confirms the existence of Cu/Cu oxide planes on the corresponding annealed catalysts. IL-SEM and HR-TEM analyses further identify nanodendritic Cu as being the active component for the desired production of multicarbon alcohols. In addition, such nanodendritic Cu shows a remarkably high resistance against degradation with alcohol efficiencies that can be maintained on a high level (FEalcohol = similar to 24% at-1.0 V) over 6 h, whereas the electrodeposited catalyst suffers from a rapid and drastic drop-down in the ethylene efficiency from 33% to 15%. The extraordinary stability of the annealed Cu catalyst can be assigned to a changed CO2RR mechanism and related to the complete suppression of the coupled C1/C2 hydrocarbon pathway, thereby avoiding the accumulation of poisoning surface carbon species or other Cl intermediates. The introduced multistep approach of catalyst activation was successfully applied also to other support materials, e.g. Au and Ag meshes, resulting in similarly high yields of C2 and C3 alcohols as observed for the Cu mesh support.

Herein, Cu electrocatalysts modified with sulfur proved to selectively produce formate via aqueous eCO(2)RR and thus to unexpectedly prevent the mechanistic fingerprint of Cu (i.e., the CO path). Initially, sulfur-modified copper catalysts (Cu-S) were prepared by the in situ reductive reconstruction of nano Cu-S precursors, revealing a positive correlation between particle size and selectivity toward formate.

Effects from crystalline phase distribution and copper oxide phases are ruled out as the source of enhancement through XPS and in situ XRD analysis.

In aqueous media (CO2-saturated 0.5 M KHCO3 electrolyte), these Ag foams show high activity and selectivity toward CO production at low and moderate over-Potentials. Faradaic efficiencies for CO (FECO) never fell below 90% within an extremely broad potential window of similar to 900 mV, starting at -0.3 V and reaching up to -1.2 V versus a reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE). An increased adsorption energy of CO on the Ag foam is discussed as the origin of the efficient suppression of the competing hydrogen-evolution reaction (HER) in this potential range. At potentials of <-1.1 V versus RHE, the FEH2 values significantly increase at the expense of FECO. Superimposed on this anti-correlated change in the CO and H-2 efficiencies is the rise in the CH4 efficiency to the maximum of FECH4 = 51% at -1.5 V versus RHE. As a minor byproduct, even C-C-coupled ethylene could be detected reaching a maximum Faradaic efficiency of FEC2H4 = 8.6% at -1.5 V versus RHE. Extended ec-CO2RR reveals the extremely high long-term stability of the Ag foam catalysts, with CO efficiencies never falling below 90% for more than 70 h of electrolysis at -0.8 V versus RHE (potential regime of predominant CO production).

The bimetallic adatom electrodes were prepared using under potential electrodeposition (UPD), which is able to precisely control the adatom coverage. While as little as 0.16 ML Pb surface adatoms on a polycrystalline Cu surface boosted the observed Faradaic HCOO- product selectivity 15 times, the 0.78 ML Pb/Cu catalyst showed the most favorable ratio of HCOO-/H-2 production rate thanks to the effective suppression of the HER combined with a partial (-1.0 to 1.1 V vs RHE) enhancement of the HCOO- production.

Previously, we have shown that Cu has the unique property of binding CO* without having H* UPD (underpotential deposited). However, the product distribution from Cu depends highly on the exact nature of the Cu surface. In this work, we investigate a series of Cu facets to understand how they affect the product distribution. Some carbon-carbon (CC)-coupled products are statistically shown to highly correlate, while other CC products correlate with C-1 products. We avoid studying the complex reaction network of the CO2 reduction reaction and focus instead on descriptors for the Cu facet product distribution. The coordination number distribution and the binding energies of the intermediates calculated by density functional theory are investigated as descriptors. The binding energies are close for the Cu facets, and the variation shows that two noncorrelating (orthogonal) binding energies contain up to 70% of the information from the binding energies. Further, structural analysis allows us to uniquely identify the (100)x(110) step sites as specific ethanol-producing sites from the CO2 reduction reaction\nDoi:10.1021_acscatal.9b01899", "label": []}
{"id": 3664, "data": "Title:Role of a Hydroxide Layer on Cu Electrodes in Electrochemical CO2 Reduction\nAbstract:Cu is known as one of the most promising metallic catalysts for conversion of CO2 to hydrocarbons such as methane, ethylene, and ethanol by electrochemical reduction. The oxide-derived Cu (OD-Cu) moiety has been investigated as a candidate for enhancing the activity for CO2 electrochemical reduction to C2+ products. The reduction process is affected by catalytic grain boundary, local pH, residual oxygen atoms, and other features of the catalysts. In order to understand the detailed mechanism, we performed in situ attenuated total reflection surface-enhanced infrared absorption spectroscopy (in situ ATR-SEIRAS) measurements for CO2 reduction using several different Cu electrodes whose oxidation states are controlled. The spectroscopic investigations demonstrate that a copper oxide electrode (Cu2O) has low activity against CO2 reduction on the basis of low-level detection of CO as an intermediate of CO2 reduction. On the other hand, other Cu electrodes possessing an OH layer on the Cu surface (Cu(OH)(2)/Cu) and metallic Cu exhibit higher CO2 reduction activity with significantly greater detection of produced CO. When the metallic Cu electrode is used, only one peak (2060 cm(-1)) assignable to CO bound to the atop site of Cu is observed. However, additional peaks are detected in the range of 1900-2100 cm(-1) when the Cu(OH)(2)/Cu electrode is used. To understand these findings, the adsorption energy of CO on a Cu(OH)(2)/Cu electrode and the CO stretching frequency were evaluated by performing DFT calculations. The adsorption energy is enhanced and the CO stretching frequencies are shifted to lower energy in comparison with those using a metallic Cu electrode. These results indicate that it is predominantly favorable to adsorb some CO molecules near the OH moiety of the Cu(OH)(2)/Cu electrode and to induce interactions of CO molecules with each other. This observation is consistent with the results of controlled potential electrolysis (CPE), which generates C2+ products as previously reported. When CPE is carried out in D2O solution, residual and/or adsorbed OD- groups on Cu are detected by ATR-SEIRAS and the surface of the Cu(OH)(2)/Cu electrode is confirmed to be metallic Cu, as measured by in situ Raman and XPS. From the ATR-SEIRAS experiments when switching from under CO2 to Ar during the electrochemical reduction, the OH layer is suggested to prevent deactivation of the Cu electrode via formation of the CO layer, which is detected as a bridge-bounded form on the metallic Cu electrode. The above findings indicate that the OH layer provides the advantage of attracting CO molecules closer to each other while reducing them to C2+ products without any degradation during electrolysis.\nDoi:10.1021_acscatal.9b00896", "label": []}
{"id": 3665, "data": "Title:Selectivity Control for Electrochemical CO2 Reduction by Charge Redistribution on the Surface of Copper Alloys\nAbstract:Copper is a significant platform for CO2 electroreduction catalysts because it is the only known metal to produce multi-carbon products but suffers from poor selectivity. In the early stages of the reaction pathway, a selectivity-determining step dictates if the pathway leads to formate (a dead-end) or to CO (and on to multi-carbon products). Therefore, controlling the adsorption of key intermediates, in order to steer the reaction pathway as desired, is critical for selective CO2 electroreduction. Alloying copper is a strategy in which the composition and electronic properties of the alloy surface can be finely tuned to alter the reaction intermediate adsorption behavior. Herein, through in situ Raman spectroscopy and density functional theory (DFT) calculations, we investigate a composition-dependent selectivity toward CO and formate during CO2 electroreduction on a range of Cu-Sn alloy catalysts. We find that the selectivity shifts from CO to formate generation as the Sn content in the alloy catalyst increases because of a shift in adsorption preference from the C-bound *COOH intermediate to the O-bound *OCHO intermediate. Theoretical DFT calculation results indicate that this selectivity shift is due to a gradual weakening of *COOH adsorption and strengthening of *OCHO that occurs with increasing Sn content. A combination of theoretical Bader charge analysis and experimental X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy revealed the origin of such transformation: upon alloying, charge is redistributed from Sn to Cu, which creates regions of localized positive charge on the Sn sites. Therefore, with increasing tin content, these localized positive sites hinder the nucleophilic attack of the CO2 carbon, making *COOH adsorption (and the CO pathway) less favorable.\nDoi:10.1021_acscatal.9b02312", "label": [[110, 116, "alloy"], [966, 973, "HCOOH"], [1016, 1021, "Cu-M"]]}

Our Cu/Au catalyst produces formate in a significant yield at -0.4 V vs the reversible hydrogen electrode in a near-neutral electrolyte and achieves a partial current density of 10.4 mA cm(-2) and a Faradaic efficiency of 81% at -0.6 V, which is 15 times more active and 4 times more selective than the control Cu catalyst derived in the same way but without Au. Electrochemical and spectroscopic studies reveal that the metal-metal interactions in the Cu/Au catalyst lead to the disappearance of Au's characteristic electrocatalytic activity for reducing CO2 and for oxidizing CO and to the stabilization of Cu1+ species on the Cu surface at CO2 reduction potentials.

The activity is also strongly influenced by the morphology, size, and distribution of catalytic particles. For CO2 hydrogenation, the size of the active copper area on top of the SrTiO3 perovskite catalyst support can affect the activity, selectivity, and stability. Here, a detailed theoretical study of the effect of bifunctionality on an important chemical CO2 transformation reaction, the reverse water gas shift (RWGS) reaction, is presented. Using density functional theory computation results for the RWGS pathway on three surfaces, namely, Cu(111), SrTiO3, and the Cu/SrTiO3 interface between both solid phases, we construct the energy landscape of the reaction. The adsorbate-adsorbate lateral interactions are taken into account for catalytic surfaces, which show a sufficient intermediate coverage. The mechanism, combining all three surfaces, is used in mesoscale kinetic Monte Carlo simulations to study the turnover and yield for CO production as a function of particle size. It is shown that the reaction proceeds faster at the interface. However, including copper and the support sites in addition to the interface accelerates the conversion even further, showing that the bifunctionality of the catalyst manifests in a more complex interplay between the phases than just the interface effect, such as the hydrogen spillover. We identify three distinct effects, the electronic, cooperative, and geometric effects, and show that the surrounded smaller Cu features on the set of supporting SrTiO3 show a higher CO formation rate, resulting in a decreasing RWGS model trend with the increasing Cu island size. The findings are in parallel with experiments, showing that they explain the previously observed phenomena and confirming the size sensitivity for the catalytic RWGS reaction.\nDoi:10.1021_acscatal.9b05303", "label": []}

Differences in total and product current densities, the ratio of current densities for HER (the hydrogen evolution reaction) to CO2RR, and the ratio of current densities for C2+ to C-1 products depend on the electrochemically active surface and are nearly independent of plasma composition. Theoretical analysis of an electropolished and roughened Cu surface reveals a higher fraction of undercoordinated Cu sites on the roughened surface, sites that bind CO preferentially. Roughened surfaces also contain square sites similar to those on a Cu(100) surface but with neighboring step sites, which adsorb OC-COH, a precursor to C2+ products.

An inherent challenge in the development of these reactors is delivering sufficient water to the cathode to sustain the CO2 reduction reaction, while also preventing accumulation of excess water at the porous cathode (i.e., flooding). We present herein experimental evidence showing cathode flooding in a zero-gap electrolyzer at 200 mA/cm(2). This flooding causes a 37% decrease in partial current density for CO production (j(CO)) along with a 450 mV increase in cell voltage (E-cell). We show that the detrimental effects associated with this flooding can be mitigated by pairing thin membranes (i.e., <= 40 mu m) with hydrophobic cathodes to enable CO2 electrolysis at commercially relevant conditions (j(CO) >= 100 mA/cm(2) and E-cell < 3 V).\nDoi:10.1021_acsenergylett.0c00637", "label": []}

The selectivity to the formation of the key C-C bond is enhanced at higher cathodic potentials as a consequence of increased copper metallicity. In addition, the reduction of the copper oxide electrode and oxygen loss in the lattice reconstructs the electrode to yield a rougher surface with more uncoordinated sites, which controls the dissociation barrier of water and CO2.

To understand this phenomenon, mechanistic studies typically chose ethylene (C2H4) as the model compound. The pathways to form other C-2 compounds such as ethane (C2H6) and ethanol are then generally considered to be similar to that of C2H4. However, regular detection of C2H6 or ethanol on thick oxide derived Cu at low overpotentials, often with selectivities exceeding that of C2H4, raises an important question: does the formation of these two C-2 molecules really share a common route with C2H4? In this work, through an investigation of CO2 electroreduction on oxide-derived Cu of different thicknesses and oxidation states, we show that the formation of C2H6 and ethanol on thick oxide-derived Cu films could proceed through routes distinct from that of C2H4 at low overpotentials. Investigations using select molecular precursors such as diacetyl [(CH3CO)(2)] suggest that the formation of C2H6 on thick oxide-derived Cu surfaces is likely to originate from the dimerization of -CH3 intermediates.

In this work, we vary the synthetic-ligand/copper molar ratio from 0.1 to 1.0 and the silver/copper atomic ratio from 0 to 0.7 and study the variations in the nanocrystals' size distribution, morphology and reactivity at rates of >= 100 mA cm(-2) in a gas-fed recycle electrolyzer operating under neutral to mildly basic conditions (0.1-1.0 M KHCO3). High-resolution electron microscopy and spectroscopy are used in order to characterize the morphology of sub-10 nm Cu-Ag nanodimers and core-shells and to elucidate trends in Ag coverage and surface composition. It is shown that Cu-Ag nanocrystals can be densely dispersed onto a carbon black support without the need for immediate ligand removal or binder addition, which considerably facilitates their application. Although CO2RR product distribution remains an intricate function of time, (kinetic) overpotential and processing conditions, we nevertheless conclude that the ratio of oxygenates to hydrocarbons (which depends primarily on the initial dispersion of the nanocrystals and their composition) rises 3-fold at moderate Ag atom % relative to Cu NCs-based electrodes. Finally, the merits of this particular Cu-Ag/C system and the recycling reactor employed are utilized to obtain maximum C-2-C-3 partial current densities of 92-140 mA cm(-2) at -1.15 V-RHE and liquid product concentrations in excess of 0.05 wt % in 1 M KHCO3 after short electrolysis periods.\nDoi:10.1021_acsnano.1c04943", "label": [[75, 80, "Cu-M"], [367, 374, "C2+"], [808, 956, "structure control"]]}

We find that a chemisorbed CO2 molecule at the present electrode/aqueous interface can be spontaneously formed and the overpotentials can affect its coordination pattern. The Eley-Rideal mechanism may be more favorable during the initial CO2 electroreduction into CO, whereas chemisorbed CO2 reacting with adsorbed H into HCOO- via the Langmuir-Hinshelwood mechanism is more facile to occur. The analyses of energetics suggest that the low overpotentials have a negligible influence on CO and HCOO- formation, and HCOO- species with monodentate and bidentate configurations may also parallelly form with the surmountable barriers at room temperature. However, the high potentials have an interruptive effect on initial CO2 electroreduction because of the significantly increased barriers, indicating that the chemisorbed CO2 can be stabilized by imposing more negative potentials and thus going against initial CO2 electroreduction. By analyzing the competing HER with initial CO2 electroreduction into CO, we find that HER is competitive with initial CO formation because of the required lower overpotentials. Simultaneously, the present study shows that the blocked Cu surface by adsorbed H and CO can explain why the initial CO formation pathway is unfavorable at the high overpotentials.

The electrochemical reduction of CO2 is carried out via the polarization technique within the experimented potential regime vs saturated calomel electrode (SCE).

Our present studies indicate that CHO is a crucial intermediate toward C-1 products on Cu(111), and dimer OCCO is found to not be a viable species for the production of C-2 products on Cu(100). The reaction pathway of CHO with CO and CHO dimerization into dimers COCHO and CHOCHO may be C-C bond formation mechanisms at low overpotential. However, at medium overpotential, C-C bond coupling takes place preferentially through the reaction of COH with CO species and COH dimerization into dimers COCOH and COHCOH.

The results indicate that our present defined CH2O and CHOH pathways may be able to parallelly take place at low overpotentials. Notably, the applied potentials will not alter the optimal CO2 reduction mechanisms. However, the presence of high overpotentials makes CO2 electroreduction more favorable, thus explaining why high overpotentials at experiments are required during CO2 electroreduction on Cu. Based on the potential-dependent energetics, the results suggest that COOH and CHO intermediates may be unstable at low overpotentials, in which COOH can easily change back to CO2 and CHO can easily change back to CO, thus preventing CO2 electroreduction. However, the high overpotentials will facilitate the formation and further electroreduction of CO and CHO. Thus, we can speculate that CO formation and then further electroreduction into CHO are the possible potential-limiting steps during CO2 electroreduction, which are regarded as the origin of experimentally observed high overpotentials.

The catalyst was focused on the strong localized surface plasmonic resonance (LSPR) on the Au nanoparticles which led to the amplification of hot electrons between CuTiP nanosheets and the effective charge separation. The electrostatic force microscopy for CuTiP/Au provided the images of electrons that moved into the interface between the Au nanoparticle and CuTiP sheet as the voltage increases from 0 to 5.0 V. There was no product selectivity for the CO2 conversion reaction on the CuTiP nanosheet, but the selectivity into methane (CH4) was significantly increased by anchoring Au nanoparticles.

The density functional theory was used to support the proposed mechanism. The intensity-modulated photovoltage spectroscopy demonstrated that the recombination time between electrons and holes is remarkably slow on CuTiP/Au/CuTiP.

Here, we demonstrate substitution of Cu with an isomorphic atom, i.e., Ni, in CuO and utilize it for improving the hydrocarbon selectivity by 4 times as compared to that of pristine CuO.

Due to the stability of its structure, it is notoriously regarded as an inert molecule that will only react under harsh conditions such as high temperature or pressure. Electrochemical reduction of CO2 to value-added materials is a sustainable and potentially profitable way to curb greenhouse gas emissions; however, the challenge of amassing a sizable CO2 concentration in the active medium persists. Here, we find that various amines, already known to be effective absorbents for CO2 through the formation of carbamates, can be used directly as substrates for selectively reducing CO2 to carbon monoxide (CO) at room temperature and ambient pressure. Several primary amines were evaluated using glassy carbon and copper working electrodes for systematic comparison. Here, we demonstrated that use of copper electrodes dramatically enhances current density (up to -18.4 mA/cm(2) at -0.76 V vs RHE) compared to glassy carbon electrodes (-0.63 mA/cm(2)) using ethylenediamine (EDA) as the catalyst. Moreover, the faradic efficiency was significantly increased from 2.3% to 58%. This concrete finding shows potential to enhance amine catalytic activity for efficient CO2 reduction. This research has introduced a potentially more sustainable and green method for carbon capture and reduction systems.\nDoi:10.1021_acssuschemeng.9b06837", "label": []}

Thin films of supported Cu catalysts are deposited on RDE tips following a procedure well-established in the fuel cell community. Lead (Pb) underpotential deposition (UPD) is used to determine the electrochemical surface area (ECSA) of thin films of 40 wt % Cu/VC, 20 wt % Cu/SWNT, 50 wt % Cu/KB, and commercial 20 wt % Cu/VC catalysts on glassy carbon electrodes. Faradaic efficiencies of four carbon-supported Cu catalysts toward CO2 electroreduction to hydrocarbons are compared to that of electrodeposited smooth Cu films. For all the catalysts studied, the only hydrocarbons detected by GC are CH4 and C2H4. The Cu nanoparticles are found to be more active toward C2H4 generation versus electrodeposited smooth copper films. For the supported Cu nanocatalysts, the ratio of C2H4/CH4 Faradaic efficiencies is believed to be a function of particle size, as higher ratios are observed for smaller Cu nanoparticles. This is likely due to an increase in the fraction of under-coordinated sites, such as corners, edges, and defects, as the nanopartides become smaller.\nDoi:10.1021_cs500537y", "label": []}

Films 1.7-3.6 mu m thick exhibited the best selectivity for these C-2 compounds at -0.99 V vs RHE, with faradic efficiencies (FE) of 34-39% for ethylene and 9-16% for ethanol. Less than 1% methane was formed. A high C2H4/CH4 products' ratio of up to similar to 100 could be achieved. Scanning electron microscopy, X-ray diffraction, and in situ Raman spectroscopy revealed that the Cu2O films reduced rapidly and remained as metallic Cu-0 particles during the CO2 reduction. The selectivity trends exhibited by the catalysts during CO2 reduction in phosphate buffer, and KHCO3 electrolytes suggest that an increase in local pH at the surface of the electrode is not the only factor in enhancing the formation of C-2 products. An optimized surface population of edges and steps on the catalyst is also necessary to facilitate the dissociation of CO2 and the dimerization of the pertinent CHxO intermediates to ethylene and ethanol.\nDoi:10.1021_cs502128q", "label": [[63, 71, "C2H4"], [633, 636, "Faradaic efficiency"], [87, 102, "CuOx"], [371, 496, "structure control"]]}

A dramatic increase in the catalytic activity and selectivity for H-2 and CO was observed with decreasing Cu particle size, in particular, for NPs below 5 nm. Hydrocarbon (methane and ethylene) selectivity was increasingly suppressed for nanoscale Cu surfaces. The size dependence of the surface atomic coordination of model spherical Cu particles was used to rationalize the experimental results.

Thin Cu2O layers formed by annealing at 130 degrees C resulted in electrodes whose activities were indistinguishable from those of polycrystalline Cu. In contrast, Cu2O layers formed at 500 degrees C that were >= similar to 3 mu m thick resulted in electrodes that exhibited large roughness factors and required 0.5 V less overpotential than polycrystalline Cu to reduce CO2 at a higher rate than H2O. The combination of these features resulted in CO2 reduction geometric current densities > 1 mA/cm(2) at overpotentials < 0.4 V, a higher level of activity than all previously reported metal electrodes evaluated under comparable conditions. Moreover, the activity of the modified electrodes was stable over the course of several hours, whereas a polycrystalline Cu electrode exhibited deactivation within 1 h under identical conditions The electrodes described here may be particularly useful for elucidating the structural properties of Cu that determine the distribution between CO2 and H2O reduction and provide a promising lead for the development of practical catalysts for electrolytic fuel synthesis.\nDoi:10.1021_ja3010978", "label": []}

The simplest hydrocarbon target is methane, which can utilize existing infrastructure for natural gas storage, distribution, and consumption. Electrochemical methods for methanizing CO2 currently suffer from a combination of low activities and poor selectivities. We demonstrate that copper nanoparticles supported on glassy carbon (n-Cu/C) achieve up to 4 times greater methanation current densities compared to high-purity copper foil electrodes. The n-Cu/C electrocatalyst also exhibits an average Faradaic efficiency for methanation of 80% during extended electrolysis, the highest Faradaic efficiency for room-temperature methanation reported to date. We find that the level of copper catalyst loading on the glassy carbon support has an enormous impact on the morphology of the copper under catalytic conditions and the resulting Faradaic efficiency for methane. The improved activity and Faradaic efficiency for methanation involves a mechanism that is distinct from what is generally thought to occur on copper foils. Electrochemical data indicate that the early steps of methanation on n-Cu/C involve a pre-equilibrium one-electron transfer to CO2 to form an adsorbed radical, followed by a rate-limiting non-electrochemical step in which the adsorbed CO2 radical reacts with a second CO2 molecule from solution.

Herein, two stable copper(I)-based coordination polymer (NNU-32 and NNU-33(S)) catalysts are synthesized and integrated into a CO2 flow cell electrolyzer, which exhibited very high selectivity for electrocatalytic CO2 -to-CH4 conversion due to clearly inherent intramolecular cuprophilic interactions. Substitution of hydroxyl radicals for sulfate radicals during the electrocatalytic process results in an in situ dynamic crystal structure transition from NNU-33(S) to NNU-33(H), which further strengthens the cuprophilic interactions inside the catalyst structure. Consequently, NNU-33(H) with enhanced cuprophilic interactions shows an outstanding product (CH4) selectivity of 82% at -0.9 V (vs reversible hydrogen electrode, j = 391 mA cm(-2) ), which represents the best crystalline catalyst for electrocatalytic CO2-to-CH4 conversion to date.

As in situ electrochemical mechanism determination by experiments is still out of reach, such mechanistic analysis typically is conducted using density functional theory (DFT). The semilocal exchange-correlation (XC) approximations most often used to model such catalysis unfortunately engender a basic error: predicting the wrong adsorption site for CO (a key CO2RR intermediate) on the most ubiquitous facet of Cu, namely, Cu(111). This longstanding inconsistency casts lingering doubt on previous DFT predictions of the attendant CO2RR kinetics. Here, we apply embedded correlated wavefunction (ECW) theory, which corrects XC functional error, to study the CO2RR on Cu(111) via both surface hydride (*H) transfer and proton-coupled electron transfer (PCET). We predict that adsorbed CO (*CO) reduces almost equally to two intermediates, namely, hydroxymethylidyne (*COH) and formyl (*CHO) at -0.9 V vs the RHE. In contrast, semilocal DFT approximations predict a strong preference for *COH. With increasing applied potential, the dominance of *COH (formed via potential-independent surface *H transfer) diminishes, switching to the competitive formation of both *CHO and *COH (both formed via potential-dependent PCET). Our results also demonstrate the importance of including explicitly modeled solvent molecules in predicting electron-transfer barriers and reveal the pitfalls of overreliance on simple surface *H transfer models of reduction reactions.\nDoi:10.1021_jacs.1c00880", "label": []}

We consequently achieved a high C2+ production rate of 255 +/- 5.7 mA cm(-2) with a 64 +/- 1.4% faradaic efficiency, as well as outstanding operational stability at 300 mA cm(-2) over 45 h in a flow reactor, largely outperforming its wettable copper counterparts.\nDoi:10.1021_jacs.1c01190", "label": [[736, 895, "structure control"], [19, 25, "Cu"], [1076, 1079, "C2+"], [1128, 1139, "Faradaic efficiency"]]}

Thus, far, efficient and selective electroreduction of CO2 to deeply reduced products such as hydrocarbons remains a big challenge.

We compared the CO2RR selectivity of Cu catalysts subjected to either potentiostatic conditions (fixed applied potential of -0.7 V-RHE) or pulsed electrolysis conditions (1 s pulses at oxidative potentials ranging from E-an = 0.6 to 1.5 V-RHE , followed by 1 s pulses at -0.7 V-RHE ) and identified the main parameters responsible for the enhanced product selectivity observed in the latter case. Herein, two distinct regimes were observed: (i) for E-an = 0.9 V-RHE we obtained 10% enhanced C-2 product selectivity (FEC2H4 = 43.6% and FEC2H5 OH = 19.8%) in comparison to the potentiostatic CO2RR at -0.7 V-RHE (FEC2H4 = 40.9% and FEC2H5OH = 11%), (ii) while for E-an = 1.2 V-RHE, high CH4 selectivity (FECH4 = 48.3% vs 1% at constant -0.7 V-RHE) was observed. Operando spectroscopy (XAS, SERS) and ex situ microscopy (SEM and TEM) measurements revealed that these differences in catalyst selectivity can be ascribed to structural modifications and local pH effects. The morphological reconstruction of the catalyst observed after pulsed electrolysis with E-an = 0.9 V-RHE, including the presence of highly defective interfaces and grain boundaries, was found to play a key role in the enhancement of the C-2 product formation. In turn, pulsed electrolysis with E-an = 1.2 V-RHE caused the consumption of OH - species near the catalyst surface, leading to an OH-poor environment favorable for CH4 production.\nDoi:10.1021_jacs.1c03443", "label": [[1514, 1518, "C2H4"], [29, 32, "Cu"], [1410, 1437, "defect"]]}

We report here that these effects can be attributed to a previously unrecognized consequence of cation hydrolysis occurring in the vicinity of the cathode. With increasing cation size, the pKa for cation hydrolysis decreases and is sufficiently low for hydrated K+, Rb+, and Cs+ to serve as buffering agents. Buffering lowers the pH near the cathode, leading to an increase in the local concentration of dissolved CO2. The consequences of these changes are an increase in cathode activity, a decrease in Faradaic efficiencies for H-2 and CH4, and an increase in Faradaic efficiencies for CO, C2H4, and C2H5OH, in full agreement with experimental observations for CO2 reduction over Ag and Cu.\nDoi:10.1021_jacs.6b07612", "label": []}

Here, we carry out QM calculations with an explicit description of water on the Cu(100) surface (experimentally shown to be stable under CO2 reduction reaction conditions) to examine the initial reaction pathways to form CO and formate (HCOO-) from CO2 through free energy calculations at 298 K and pH 7. We find that CO formation proceeds from physisorbed CO2 to chemisorbed CO2 (*CO2 delta-), with a free energy barrier of Delta G(double dagger) = 0.43 eV, the rate-determining step (RDS). The subsequent barriers of protonating *CO2 delta- to form COOH* and then dissociating COOH* to form *CO are 0.37 and 0.30 eV, respectively. HCOO- formation proceeds through a very different pathway in which physisorbed CO2 reacts directly with a surface H* (along with electron transfer), leading to Delta G(double dagger) = 0.80 eV. Thus, the competition between CO formation and HCOO- formation occurs in the first electron-transfer step. On Cu(100), the RDS for CO formation is lower, making CO the predominant product. Thus, to alter the product distribution, we need to control this first step of CO2 binding, which might involve controlling pH, alloying, or changing the structure at the nanoscale.\nDoi:10.1021_jacs.6b08534", "label": []}

Presently Cu is the only metallic electrocatalyst known to reduce CO2 to appreciable amounts of hydrocarbons, but often a wide range of products such as CO2 HCOO-, and H-2 are formed as well. Better catalysts that exhibit high activity and especially high selectivity for specific products are needed. Here a range of bimetallic Cu-Pd catalysts with ordered, disordered, and phase-separated atomic arrangements (Cu-at:Pd-at = 1:1), as well as two additional disordered arrangements (Cu3Pd and CuPd3 with Cu-at:Pd-at = 3:1 and 1:3), are studied to determine key factors needed to achieve high selectivity for C1 or C2 chemicals in CO2 reduction. When compared with the disordered and phase-separated CuPd catalysts, the ordered CuPd catalyst exhibits the highest selectivity for Cl products (>80%). The phase-separated CuPd and Cu3Pd achieve higher selectivity (>60%) for C2 chemicals than CuPd3 and ordered CuPd, which suggests that the probability of dimerization of Cl intermediates is higher on surfaces with neighboring Cu atoms. Based on surface valence band spectra, geometric effects rather than electronic effects seem to be key in determining the selectivity of bimetallic Cu Pd catalysts. These results imply that selectivities to different products can be tuned by geometric arrangements.

Syngas, a mixture of carbon monoxide (CO) and hydrogen (H-2), is an important chemical precursor that can be converted downstream into small molecules or larger hydrocarbons by fermentation or thermochemistry. Many processes that utilize syngas require different syngas compositions: we therefore pursued the rational design of a family of electrocatalysts that can be programmed to synthesize different designer syngas ratios. We utilize in situ surface enhanced Raman spectroscopy and first-principles density functional theory calculations to develop a systematic picture of CO* binding on Cu-enriched Au surface model systems.

To date, copper has been found to be the most effective catalyst for electrochemically reducing carbon dioxide to products such as methane, ethene, and ethanol. Unfortunately, the current efficiency of the process is limited by competition with the relatively facile hydrogen evolution reaction. Since multi-carbon products are more valuable precursors to chemicals and fuels than methane, there is considerable interest in modifying copper to enhance the multi-carbon product selectivity. Here, we report our investigations of electrochemical carbon dioxide reduction over CuAg bimetallic electrodes and surface alloys, which we find to be more selective for the formation of multi-carbon products than pure copper: This selectivity enhancement is a result of the selective suppression of hydrogen evolution, which occurs due to compressive strain induced by the formation of a CuAg surface alloy. Furthermore, we report that these bimetallic electrocatalysts exhibit an unusually high selectivity for the formation of multi-carbon carbonyl-containing products, which we hypothesize to be the consequence of a reduced coverage of adsorbed hydrogen and the reduced oxophilicity of the compressively strained copper. Thus, we show that promoting copper surface with small amounts of Ag is a promising means for improving the multi-carbon oxygenated product selectivity of copper during electrochemical CO2 reduction.\nDoi:10.1021_jacs.7b08607", "label": [[64, 68, "Cu-M"], [1029, 1209, "alloy"], [768, 788, "C2+"]]}

However, a mechanistic understanding of CO2 reduction on nanostructured Cu catalysts has been lacking. Herein we show that the structurally precise ligand-protected Cu-hydride nanoclusters, such as Cu32H20L12 (L is a dithiophosphate ligand), offer unique selectivity for electrocatalytic CO2 reduction at low overpotentials. Our density functional theory (DFT) calculations predict that the presence of the negatively charged hydrides in the copper cluster plays a critical role in determining the selectivity of the reduction product, yielding HCOOH over CO with a lower overpotential. The HCOOH formation proceeds via the lattice-hydride mechanism: first, surface hydrides reduce CO2 to HCOOH product, and then the hydride vacancies are readily regenerated by the electrochemical proton reduction. DFT calculations further predict that hydrogen evolution is less competitive than HCOOH formation at the low overpotential. Confirming the predictions, electrochemical tests of CO2 reduction on the Cu32H20L12 cluster demonstrate that HCOOH is indeed the main product at low overpotential, while H-2 production dominates at higher overpotential. The unique selectivity afforded by the lattice-hydride mechanism opens the door for further fundamental and applied studies of electrocatalytic CO2 reduction by copper-hydride nanoclusters and other metal nanoclusters that contain hydrides.\nDoi:10.1021_jacs.7b05591", "label": []}

Surface-enhanced infrared absorption spectroscopy allows direct observation of several reaction intermediates that have never been detected before, except for the commonly detected CO.

In this study, we have employed size-controlled (similar to 5 nm) Cu100-xZnx nanoparticles (NPs) supported on carbon to investigate the correlation between their structure and composition and catalytic performance.

Samples containing a higher Zn concentration displayed significantly lower CH4 production and an abrupt switch in the selectivity to CO. Lack of metal leaching was observed based on quasi in situ X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS).

However, the origin of such enhanced selectivity remains controversial. Here, we prepared two Cu-based electrodes with mixed oxidation states, namely, HQ-Cu (containing Cu, Cu2O, CuO) and AN-Cu (containing Cu, Cu(OH)(2)). We extracted an ultrathin specimen from the electrodes using a focused ion beam to investigate the distribution and evolution of various Cu species by electron microscopy and electron energy loss spectroscopy. We found that at the steady stage of the CO2RR, the electrodes have all been reduced to Cu-0, regardless of the initial states, suggesting that the high C2+ selectivities are not associated with specific oxidation states of Cu. We verified this conclusion by control experiments in which HQ-Cu and AN-Cu were pretreated to fully reduce oxides/hydroxides to Cu-0, and the pretreated electrodes showed even higher C2+ selectivity compared with their unpretreated counterparts. We observed that the oxide/hydroxide crystals in HQ-Cu and AN-Cu were fragmented into nanosized irregular Cu grains under the applied negative potentials. Such a fragmentation process, which is the consequence of an oxidation-reduction cycle and does not occur in electropolished Cu, not only built an intricate network of grain boundaries but also exposed a variety of high-index facets. These two features greatly facilitated the C-C coupling, thus accounting for the enhanced C2+ selectivity.

In this study, the electrochemical CO2 reduction mechanism over the Cu catalysts with various oxidation states was studied by using in situ surface-enhanced infrared absorption spectroscopy (SEIRAS), in situ soft X-ray absorption spectroscopy (Cu L-edge), and online gas chromatography measurements. The atop-adsorbed CO (COatop) intermediate is obtained on the electrodeposited Cu surface which primarily has the oxidation state of Cu(I). CO atop is further reduced, followed by the formation of C-1 product such as CH4. The residual bridge-adsorbed CO (CObridge) is formed on the as-prepared Cu surface with Cu(0) which inhibits hydrocarbon formation. In contrast, the CV-treated Cu electrode prepared by oxidizing the as-prepared Cu surface contains different amounts of Cu(I) and Cu(0) states. The major theme of this work is that in situ SEIRAS results show the coexistence of COatop and CObridge as the reaction intermediates during CO2 reduction and that the selectivity of CO2-to-ethylene conversion is further enhanced in the CV-treated Cu electrode. The Cu catalysts modulated by the electrochemical method exhibit different oxidation states and reaction intermediates as well as electrocatalytic properties.\nDoi:10.1021_jacs.9b11126", "label": []}

To date, copper is the best metal catalyst; however the overpotential to achieve this reaction on Cu is excessively high. It follows that the development of a catalyst to efficiently catalyze the conversion with a low overpotential at a reasonable current density is needed. Many aspects of the molecular details of the reaction are still unclear. In this work, DFT calculations are applied to investigate CO2 electroreduction to CH4 over Cu3Ag and Cu3Au stepped surfaces (211) compared to that over Cu(211). In the resulting analysis, the Cu3Ag surface shows a slightly lower overpotential and suppresses OH poisoning compared to the Cu surface, yet the selectivity toward H-2 increases. The Cu3Au is not a good candidate due to higher overpotential and a relatively weak CO adsorption resulting in CO desorption rather than further reduction. The CO desorption can also be problematic on Cu3Ag as well. The thermodynamics and kinetics of the nonelectrochemical hydrogenations are also examined to explore alternative paths which might result in an absence of formaldehyde intermediate production during CO2 reduction on Cu.\nDoi:10.1021_jp400937e", "label": []}

These systems were chosen to investigate the effect of strain on the catalytic activity of Cu surfaces and to obtain information about the role of steps in this process. The selectivity toward hydrocarbons on the copper overlayers is much lower than on polycrystalline copper due to a higher selectivity for hydrogen evolution. With the aim of understanding the lower activity toward CO2 electroreduction of the Cu overlayers, we also studied the surfaces under reaction condition using electrochemical scanning tunneling microscopy (EC-STM). In the presence of CO, the Cu overlayer changes from a flat to a granular structure exposing part of the Pt surface. The exposed Pt surface accounts for the high selectivity of these structures toward hydrogen evolution. These results illustrate the dynamic nature of the surface under reaction conditions and that in situ measurements are crucial to understand catalytic activity.\nDoi:10.1021_jp406913f", "label": []}

In 0.01 M NaOH, a Cu monolayer deposited on an Au(111) single crystal exhibits markedly different redox behavior from Cu multilayers on the same substrate: the Cu monolayer is more stable against oxide formation and, at high potentials (E > 0.5 V vs RHE), undergoes a direct phase transition from Cu-0 to CuO rather than forming an intermediate Cu2O phase. The Cu monolayer in its metallic state at low potentials is expanded by 12.5% to match the substrate lattice constant, which can be expected to influence significantly the interaction of Cu surface atoms with intermediates of the electrochemical CO2 reduction. However, we also find that both strained Cu monolayer and thick, structurally relaxed Cu islands are unstable with respect to place-exchange with subsurface Au atoms.

The system was studied using cyclic voltammetry, chronoamperometry, and electron spin resonance (ESR) spectroscopy. Addition Of 100% CO2 to a solution of Fc in [C(2)mim][NTf2] resulted in a substantial increase in both the limiting oxidative current and diffusion coefficient of Fc. Arrhenius plots of Fc diffusion coefficients in the pure and CO2-saturated ionic liquid revealed a decrease in activation energy of translational diffusion from 29.0 (+/- 0.5) kJ mol(-1) to 14.7 (+/- 1.6) kJ mol(-1), suggesting a reduction in the viscosity of the ionic liquid with addition Of CO2. ESR spectroscopy was then used to calculate the rotational correlation coefficients of a probe molecule, 2,2,6,6-tetramethyl-1-piperinyloxyl (TEMPO), to add supporting evidence to this hypothesis. Arrhenius plots of rotational correlation coefficients in the pure and CO2-saturated ionic liquid resulted in a similar drop in activation energy from 28.7 (+/- 2.1) kJ mol(-1) to 18.2 (+/- 5.6) kJ mol(-1).

With decreasing Cu layer thickness, the formation of methane decreased much faster than that of ethylene. As a result, the relative faradaic selectivity of the technologically useful product ethylene increased sharply.

Theoretical calculations further revealed that the high selectivity and activity on CuN2O2 active sites are due to the proper elevated CH4 and H-2 energy barrier and fine-tuned electronic structure of Cu active sites. Single-atom catalysts (SACs) are promising candidates to catalyze CO2 reduction for the formation of high value hydrocarbons but most of the reactions yield CO.

Renewable methane produced using CO2 electroreduction attracts interest due to the established global distribution network; however, present-day efficiencies and activities remain below those required for practical application. Here we exploit the fact that the suppression of *CO dimerization and hydrogen evolution promotes methane selectivity: we reason that the introduction of Au in Cu favors *CO protonation vs. C-C coupling under low *CO coverage and weakens the *H adsorption energy of the surface, leading to a reduction in hydrogen evolution. We construct experimentally a suite of Au-Cu catalysts and control *CO availability by regulating CO2 concentration and reaction rate. This strategy leads to a 1.6x improvement in the methane:H-2 selectivity ratio compared to the best prior reports operating above 100 mA cm(-2). We as a result achieve a CO2-to-methane Faradaic efficiency (FE) of (56 +/- 2)% at a production rate of (112 +/- 4) mA cm(-2).

This C shell epitaxially grew on Cu with quasi-graphitic bonding via a gas-solid reaction governed by the CO (g) - CO2 (g) - C (s) equilibrium. The quasi-graphitic C shell-coated Cu was stable during the CO2 reduction reaction and provided a platform for rational material design. C2+ product selectivity could be additionally improved by doping p-block elements. These elements modulated the electronic structure of the Cu surface and its binding properties, which can affect the intermediate binding and CO dimerization barrier. B-modified Cu attained a 68.1% Faradaic efficiency for C2H4 at -0.55V (vs RHE) and a C2H4 cathodic power conversion efficiency of 44.0%. In the case of N-modified Cu, an improved C2+ selectivity of 82.3% at a partial current density of 329.2mA/cm(2) was acquired.

One reason for this is the formation of precipitates in the porous cathode from the alkaline electrolyte and the CO2 feed. Here we show that while precipitate formation is detrimental for the long-term stability, the presence of alkali metal cations at the cathode improves performance. To overcome this contradiction, we develop an operando activation and regeneration process, where the cathode of a zero-gap electrolyser cell is periodically infused with alkali cation-containing solutions. This enables deionized water-fed electrolysers to operate at a CO2 reduction rate matching those using alkaline electrolytes (CO partial current density of 420 +/- 50 mA cm(-2) for over 200 hours). We deconvolute the complex effects of activation and validate the concept with five different electrolytes and three different commercial membranes. Finally, we demonstrate the scalability of this approach on a multicell electrolyser stack, with an active area of 100 cm(2) per cell.

Here, by reducing mixtures of (CO)-C-13 and (CO2)-C-12, we show that oxide-derived Cu catalysts have three different types of active sites for C-C coupled products, one that produces ethanol and acetate, another that produces ethylene and yet another that produces 1-propanol. In contrast, we do not find evidence of product-specific sites on polycrystalline Cu and oriented (100) and (111) Cu surfaces.

Here we studied CO2 reduction on gold electrodes through cyclic voltammetry and showed that, without a metal cation, the reaction does not take place in a pure 1 mM H2SO4 electrolyte.

To identify possible intermediates in the reduction of carbon dioxide we have studied the reduction of small C-1 and C-2 organic molecules containing oxygen. We followed the formation and consumption of intermediates during the reaction as a function of potential, using online mass spectrometry. For the C-1 pathway we show that it is very likely that CHOads is the key intermediate towards the breaking of the C-O bond and, therefore, the formation of methane. For the C-2 pathway we suggest that the first step is the formation of a CO dimer, followed by the formation of a surface-bonded enediol or enediolate, or the formation of an oxametallacycle. Both the enediol(ate) and the oxametallacycle would explain the selectivity of the C-2 pathway towards ethylene.

After initiation of the electrochemical CO2 reduction by these oxide structures, the selectivity of the process was found to largely depend on the parent Cu2O film thickness, rather than on the initial crystal orientation. Starting with thin Cu2O films, besides CO and hydrogen, selective formation of ethylene is observed with very high ethylene-to-methane ratios (similar to 8 to 12). In addition to these products, thicker Cu2O films yield a remarkably large amount of ethane. Long term Faradaic efficiency analysis of hydrocarbons shows no sign of deactivation of the electrodes after 5 hours of continuous experiment.

On Cu(111), COads is firstly formed by the dissociative hydrogenation of CO2, and CHOads and CH2Oads are the key intermediates towards the chemical and electrochemical reduction of CO2 into methanol and CH4. Despite being thermodynamically or kinetically favoured, it is likely that CH2OHads instead of CH3Oads is the intermediate for methanol and CH4 formation. Based on the activation barriers, CH2OHads intermediate either forms CH3OH by direct hydrogenation or forms CH2ads by hydrogenative dissociation, which may be a parallel path in the CO2 reduction mechanism on the Cu(111) surface. Finally, the CH2 intermediate leads to formation of the hydrocarbons. On Cu(100), CO2 reduction takes a different pathway in the early stages; CO is formed through the direct dissociation of CO2 rather than hydrogenative dissociation as on the Cu(111) surface due to stronger bonding of CO. Further reduction of CO also undergoes a different pathway, in which CO dimerization is more easy to achieve, whereas CO hydrogenation is difficult on the Cu(100) surface. This explains why C2H4 is formed more favorably on the Cu(100) surface and CH4 is predominantly produced on the Cu(111) surface under both chemical and electrochemical conditions. In addition, DFT results showed for the first time that the electrochemical reduction would be expected to be highly favored at potentials of interest by CO2 reduction compared with chemical reduction and that the carbon dioxide anion radical ((CO2-)-C-center dot) is involved in the initial stage of CO2 electroreduction. Simultaneously, the results also explain partly why CH3OH is formed in gas phase chemistry and only CH4 is observed in electrochemistry on copper surfaces. By analyzing the chemical and electrochemical reduction paths, important mechanistic information is deduced on the Cu single crystal surfaces. The study of CO2 reduction mechanisms on copper will lead to a deeper understanding of the reaction chemistry and could eventually lead to the design of more efficient and selective catalysts.\nDoi:10.1039_c5ra09294a", "label": []}

Density functional theory (DFT) indicates that the site occupation of the inert In occurs more on the specific sites of Cu. In addition, while In atoms do not preferentially adsorb H or CO, Cu atoms, which neighbor the In atoms, alters the preference of their adsorption. This preference for site occupation and altered adsorption may account for the improved selectivity over that observed for Cu metal. This study demonstrates an example of a scalable synthesis method of bimetallic surfaces utilized with the mixed oxide precursor having the diversity of metal choice, which may drastically alter the electrocatalytic performance, as presented herein.\nDoi:10.1039_c5ta05669a", "label": [[20, 26, "Cu-M"], [26, 32, "alloy"], [473, 476, "CO"]]}

Cu-20 nanoclusters show anodic redox processes occurring at much lower potential with respect to Cu-5 nanoclusters, which behave relatively similar to much larger Cu particles. However, Cu-5 nanoclusters coordinate effectively CO2 (hydrogen carbonate) in solution, different from Cu-20 nanoclusters and larger Cu particles. This effect, rather than the redox behavior, is apparently connected to the ability of Cu-5 nanoclusters to reduce CO2 under cathodic conditions at low overpotential. Although preliminary, these results provide rather exciting indications on the possibility of realizing low overpotential electrocatalytic conversion of CO2.\nDoi:10.1039_c6cy00942e", "label": []}

Here, we report that Cu-CDots nanocorals is a highly efficient, low-cost and stable electrocatalyst for CO2 reduction in aqueous solution. The major product of CO2 reduction on the Cu-CDots nanocorals is HCOOH with an inconceivable low overpotential of 0.13 V and a high Faraday efficiency of 79% at a moderate potential of -0.7 V vs. RHE. In the present system, CDots can increase the adsorption capacity of CO2 molecules and H+, which play important roles in CO2 reduction. The high selectivity of HCOOH for CO2 reduction may be ascribed to that CDots can greatly diminish the HCOOH desorption energy and improve the catalytic selectivity for HCOOH.

Our studies show that the doping of Ni, Pd and Pt can promote CO2 reduction into hydrocarbons and influence the selectivity of reduction pathways, in which the doping of Pt may be able to lead to the strongest catalytic activity. The adsorption behavior between reaction intermediates and surfaces is crucial and the interactions of intermediates with the catalysts should be moderate in order to efficiently catalyze CO2 reduction into CH4 and CH3OH, and avoid OH surface poisoning. The enhanced electrocatalytic activity of transition metal-doped Cu(111) surfaces may be owing to decreased overpotential and moderate electronic interactions between Cu and the doped transition metals. The doped Ni, Pd and Pt atoms can considerably decrease the overpotential and remove surface OH poisoning, in which the doped Pt can simultaneously reduce overpotential for CO formation and further reduction, and most easily remove OH, thus suggesting the best electrocatalytic activity. The moderate electron interaction between Cu and Pt and moderate upshift of the d-band center of Pt also explain why the Pt-doped Cu(111) surface has the best electrocatalytic activity for CO2 reduction. Two possible descriptors can be proposed in order to scale the electrocatalytic activity of Cu-based electrocatalysts for CO2 reduction, in which an ideal Cu-based electrocatalyst should be able to reduce barriers for CO formation and further reduction, and should have moderate electron interactions between Cu and the doped transition metals, and a moderate upshift of d-band center of the doped transition metals. In these ways, CO2 reduction pathways can be facilitated and the yield of hydrocarbons CH4 and CH3OH can be enhanced.\nDoi:10.1039_c6ra28815d", "label": []}

Most recently, modifying the electrodes with phosphate ligands through electrodepositing electrode materials has shown promising results in improving the kinetics of some reactions. However, it is unclear how the presence of phosphate anions affects the electrodeposition process and functions in catalyzing reactions. Here, we report a systematic study on electrodeposition of Cu in the presence of phosphate anions. The phosphate anions form a complex with free Cu(II) cations, competing with the electrodeposition process. The competition between the two processes results in an insufficient supply of free Cu(II) for electrodeposition, especially at the diffusion layer. This is evidenced by the calculation of free Cu(II) concentration and the electrodeposition current at identical applied potentials. We also found that the electrodeposition of Cu in the presence of phosphate generates Cu-oxyo/hydroxyo-phosphate species on the deposited copper surface. The modified electrodes with phosphate species exhibit higher selectivity for HCOOH formation (faradaic efficiency similar to 80%) from the electrochemical reduction of CO2 as compared with Cu foil (faradaic efficiency similar to 33%).

Cu is the only catalyst which converts CO2 to significant quantities of hydrocarbons and oxygenates. Here we demonstrate that oxygenate products can be favored over hydrocarbons by positioning a local source of CO generated by a CO producing catalyst (Au or Ag) in close proximity to a Cu catalyst. Use of a bimetallic device comprising interdigitated and independently controllable lines of Au and Cu allows the local CO concentration to be modulated. Notably, diffusional simulations show that the saturation concentration of CO can be exceeded locally. Actuating both the Au and Cu lines increases the oxygenate to ethylene ratio compared to actuating Cu only. Increasing the relative area of CO-producing Au relative to Cu also increases this ratio. These insights are translated into a second bimetallic system comprising Cu dots/lines patterned directly onto a Ag substrate, allowing for the distance between Cu and the CO generating metal to be precisely controlled. Controlling the relative areas of Ag and Cu allows for tuning of the oxygenate to ethylene ratio from 0.59 to 2.39 and an increase in oxygenate faradaic efficiency from 21.4% to 41.4%, while maintaining the selectivity to C-2/C-3 products in the 50-65% range. We attribute this change in selectivity to be due to an increased *CO coverage on Cu. By utilizing diffusional transport of CO to the Cu, a sequential catalysis pathway is created which allows for the control of oxygenate selectivity in aqueous CO2 reduction.\nDoi:10.1039_c8ee01501e", "label": []}

Alloys are of special interest for these applications, because of their unique chemical and physical properties that allow for highly active surfaces. Here, PdnCum (m + n = 15 and n > m) bimetallic electrocatalysts were used for systematic studies to understand the effect of the composition of Pd and Cu on the electrochemical reduction of CO2 to CO.

With the energetic analysis of the proposed reaction pathways over the Pd10Cu5 catalyst, the limiting voltages for CO2 reduction to CH3OH, CH4, and CH3CH2O have been compared.

The reduction of CO2 to CO is electrocatalyzed under alkaline conditions on precious group metal (PGM) catalysts, such as silver and gold, limiting widespread application due to high cost. Here, we report on an interesting alternative, a PGM-free nickel and nitrogen-doped porous carbon catalyst (Ni-N-C), the catalytic performance of which rivals or exceeds those of the state-of-the-art electrocatalysts under industrial electrolysis conditions. We started from small scale CO2-saturated liquid electrolyte H-cell screening tests and moved to larger-scale CO2 electrolyzer cells, where the catalysts were deployed as Gas Diffusion Electrodes (GDEs) to create a reactive three-phase interface. We compared the faradaic CO yields and CO partial current densities of Ni-N-C catalysts to those of a Ag-based benchmark, and its Fe-functionalized Fe-N-C analogue under ambient pressures, temperatures and neutral pH bicarbonate flows. Prolonged electrolyzer tests were conducted at industrial current densities of up to 700 mA cm(-2). Ni-N-C electrodes are demonstrated to provide CO partial current densities above 200 mA cm(-2) and stable faradaic CO efficiencies around 85% for up to 20 hours (at 200 mA cm(-2)), unlike their Ag benchmarks. Density functional theory-based calculations of catalytic reaction pathways help offer a molecular mechanistic basis of the observed selectivity trends on Ag and M-N-C catalysts. Computations lend much support to our experimental hypothesis as to the critical role of N-coordinated metal ion, Ni-N-x, motifs as the catalytic active sites for CO formation.

Oxide-derived Cu electrodes are among the best electrocatalysts for the selective formation of ethylene and ethanol. However, a large fraction of the faradaic current still goes to hydrogen evolution, even at optimal conditions (electrolyte, potential, etc.). Here we employ the concept of sequential catalysis using judiciously designed CuAu bimetallic catalysts through galvanic exchange between Au3+ and Cu2O nanowires. By controlling the concentration of the Au3+ precursor and the exchange time, Au nanoparticles were evenly dispersed onto the Cu2O nanowires. The optimized oxide-derived CuAu catalyst showed remarkable improvement towards the formation of ethylene, ethanol and n-propanol, in terms of faradaic efficiency and current density. Our analysis of the electrochemical formation of carbon monoxide, ethylene and hydrogen suggests that the presence of Au, an electrocatalyst for CO2-to-CO conversion, helps enhance *CO-coverage on Cu, thus promoting the production of multi-carbon products and suppressing hydrogen formation on the CuAu catalyst.

This strategy allows tuning of the selectivity of the CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR) and a decrease of the hydrogen evolution rate simultaneously by facilitating the supply of CO2 reactants and inhibiting the adsorption of water (protons). The transferring point from a pinning to bursting state turned out to be the optimized condition leading to the highest CO2RR faradaic efficiency without significant interference of current density. The optimized superaerophilic Cu NW catalyst showed CO-selectivity with a Faraday efficiency of 71% at -0.4 V vs. RHE and HCOOH-selectivity with a Faraday efficiency of 68% at -0.6 V vs. RHE. Moreover, the accelerated gas and ion diffusion and homogenized reactions also avoided accumulative damage on the surface of the Cu NWs and enhanced the stability of the Cu catalyst. This wettability tuning strategy provides a facile and efficient way to optimize the gas and ion diffusion layers, therefore promoting the performance of the CO2RR.

Herein, we demonstrated the synthesis of hollow Au-Cu nanoparticles of size ranging from 50 nm to 100 nm with a wall thickness of 4.95 +/- 0.81 nm for efficient CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR) via galvanic replacement and the Kirkendall effect between copper and gold. In the fabrication procedure, a gold precursor was pre-dissolved in TOP to lower the reduction potential of Au3+, which could then be reduced by Cu0. The obtained hollow Au-Cu NPs were then supported on carbon black for CO2RR measurement, and it exhibited a maximum CO FE of 53.3% at -0.7 V (vs. RHE), which was very close to that of Au NP/C, but the gold mass current density of hollow Au-Cu NP/C was much higher. The hollow Au-Cu NP/C also showed good stability in long-time measurements for CO2RR. To find out how the superior catalytic performance was achieved, hollow Au-Cu NP/C was then annealed in O-2 and N-2. It was found that after being annealed, the catalysts almost totally lost the activity towards CO2RR, which may be due to the partial segregation of Cu species on the nanoparticle surface as well as a decrease in the surface defect density with the improvement in crystallinity. Thus, it was concluded that high dispersion of more Au atoms on the nanoparticle surface together with the presence of more surface defect sites could account for the superior CO2RR performance of the as-synthesized hollow Au-Cu NP/C.\nDoi:10.1039_c8qi00297e", "label": [[25, 30, "Cu-M"], [106, 108, "CO"], [400, 426, "structure control"], [901, 927, "Faradaic efficiency"]]}

Single atom catalysts (SACs) on supports are considered as a class of excellent electrocatalysts with high activity, selectivity and atomic efficiency for CO2 electrochemical reduction. Supports for single atoms are believed to greatly impact the electrocatalytic activity of SACs. However, further research on the relationship between the structure of supports for SACs and CO2 electroreduction is still needed. Herein, density functional theory (DFT) calculations are performed to investigate the role of supports in tuning the CO2 electrocatalytic activity of SACs. Graphynes with different pore sizes (graphyne, graphdiyne, graphyne-3 and graphyne-4) are taken into account to unveil the effect of their skeleton structure on the anchored Cu single atoms. We found that support skeletons could greatly impact the coordination configuration of metal atoms and the steric repulsion of support skeletons to intermediates. These two factors jointly result in different electrocatalytic performances of SACs. The comparative analysis proves that the graphynes with large pores are appropriate supports for Cu adatoms for CO2 electroreduction due to the low-coordinated Cu atoms and weak-steric-repulsion carbon skeleton. Such SACs exhibit much enhanced activity and selectivity as compared with the Cu(111) surface and monoatomic Cu on nitrogen-doped graphene.

In this work, a facile strategy has been developed to obtain lattice-dislocated Bi nanowires on copper foam (Cu foam@BiNW) through in situ electrochemical transformation of an electroless plated Bi film on copper foam after thermal treatment in air. The Cu foam@BiNW is found to be a highly active electrocatalyst for CO2 reduction to formate at a low overpotential, reaching a faradaic efficiency for formate (FEformate) of 95% and a formate partial current density of approximate to 15 mA cm(-2) at -0.69 V vs. RHE. High FEformate values of above 93% were also maintained over a potential range from -0.69 V to -0.99 V vs. RHE. A Fourier transformed ac voltammetric study revealed that unlike other Bi materials, the rate determining step for CO2 reduction on the Cu foam@BiNW electrode is the reduction of protonated CO2- radical anion, which indicates the presence of new catalytic active sites on the BiNWs. The high CO2 reduction activity of the Cu foam@BiNW electrode is attributed to the high intrinsic activity arising from the presence of crystal lattice dislocations on the twisted Bi nanowires and the large catalytic surface area associated with the porous structure. This work demonstrates the use of crystal defect engineering to improve the efficiency of electrocatalytic CO2 reduction on Bi metal.\nDoi:10.1039_c9ee00018f", "label": [[38, 70, "Cu-M"], [747, 755, "HCOOH"], [837, 840, "Faradaic efficiency"], [1522, 1591, "structure control"]]}

Herein, a series of hybrid catalysts consisting of Cu nanoparticles supported on N-doped porous carbon (Cu/NPC) were prepared. It was demonstrated that the selectivity for C2H5OH or C3H7OH could be tuned by introducing N-doped porous carbon materials as cocatalysts with different pyridinic N contents, which could in situ produce a reactive CO intermediate from CO2. By varying the pyridinic N content, highly selective production of multicarbon alcohols was achieved using the Cu/NPC hybrid catalysts with a high faradaic efficiency for one pot production of multicarbon alcohols up to 73.3% at -1.05 V (vs. RHE). The faradaic efficiency for C2H5OH and C3H7OH was 64.6% and 8.7%, respectively. The pyridinic N species were likely the CO-producing sites and together with Cu catalytic sites acted cooperatively to produce C2H5OH and C3H7OH via a two-site mechanism for efficient CO2 reduction to multicarbon alcohols.

Considerably challenging is the controlled and reproducible synthesis of stable non-noble metallic nanostructures with accessible active sites. Here, we report a method of preparation of bare (ligand-free) Cu nanostructures from polycrystalline metal in a controlled manner. This procedure relies on heterogeneous localized electrorefining of polycrystalline Cu on indium tin oxide (ITO) and glassy carbon as model supports using scanning electrochemical microscopy (SECM). The morphology of nanostructures and thus their catalytic properties are tunable by adjusting the electrorefining parameters, i.e., the electrodeposition voltage, the translation rate of the metal source and the composition of the supporting electrolyte. The activity of the obtained materials towards the carbon dioxide reduction reaction (CO2RR), oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) in alkaline media and hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), is studied by feedback mode SECM. Spiky Cu nanostructures obtained at a high concentration of chloride ions exhibit enhanced electrocatalytic activity. Nanostructures deposited under high cathodic overpotentials possess a high surface-to-volume ratio with a large number of catalytic sites active towards the reversible CO2RR and ORR. The CO2RR yields easily electrooxidizable compounds - formic acid and carbon monoxide.

Using Cu-79 NP as the representative, we performed computational screening and confirmed four M-x@Cu79-x CSNPs that can stably exist. Then, the catalytic performance of the screened CSNPs was tested through first-principles calculations. The free energy profiles indicate that Fe-19@Cu-60 is more desirable for CO2RR catalysis due to its high selectivity for CO rather than HCOOH at a low potential. Moreover, when it electro-catalyzes CO2 into CH4, the Fe-19@Cu-60 CSNP exhibits much lower limiting potential (-0.58 V) compared with pure Cu-79 NP (-0.86 V) or the Cu (211) surface (-0.70 V). Taking the cost into consideration, the Fe-19@Cu-60 CSNP is highly recommended as a promising electro-catalyst for CO(2)RRs. In addition, when CO is taken as the initial reactant to be reduced, all the screened CSNPs exhibit lower limiting potentials than Cu-79 NP. From the view of material design, the significant weakening of CO binding originating from the change in the d-band center could be the reason why the formation of a core/shell structure will enhance the catalytic performance of Cu NPs in CO reduction.\nDoi:10.1039_c9nr01936g", "label": []}

The 50 nm NWs showed better selectivity than the 25 nm NWs, and catalyzed CO reduction to C-2-hydrocarbons (C2H4 + C2H6) with a combined faradaic efficiency (FE) of 60% (C2H4 FE of 35% and mass activity of 4.25 A g(-1) Cu) at -1.1 V (vs. reversible hydrogen electrode). The NW-catalyzed CO2 reduction is less efficient due to the extra CO2 to CO step required for the formation of C-2-hydrocarbons. This experimental evidence combined with DFT calculations suggests that CO is an important intermediate and NWs provide a large Cu(100) surface for *CO hydrogenation (to *CHO) and *CO-*CHO coupling, leading to more selective reduction of CO than CO2 towards C-2-hydrocarbons.\nDoi:10.1039_c9nr03170g", "label": []}

However, low-cost, Earth-abundant yet efficient and stable electrocatalysts for composition-adjustable syngas have still not been realized for practical applications. Herein, new hierarchical 0D/2D heterostructures of SnO2 nanoparticles (NPs) confined on CuS nanosheets (NSs) were designed to enable CO2 electroreduction to a wide-range syngas (CO/H-2: 0.11-3.86) with high faradaic efficiency (>85%), remarkable turnover frequency (96.12 h(-1)) and excellent durability (over 24 h). Detailed experimental characterization studies together with theoretical calculations manifest that the ascendant catalytic performance is not only attributed to the heterostructure of ultrasmall SnO2 NPs homogeneously confined on ultrathin CuS NSs, which endows the maximum exposure of active sites and faster charge transfer, but is also accounted by the strong interaction between well-defined SnO2 and CuS interfaces, which modulated reaction free-energies of reaction intermediates and hence improved the activity of CO2 electroreduction to highly ratio-tunable syngas.

In this regard, the reduction of CO(2)via electrochemical means is one of the most attractive alternatives but still requires rather unique electrodes. Considering the potential of this approach, this report describes a one-step methodology for the synthesis of carbon electrodes derived from simple paper and modified with various metallic nanoparticles.

However, the low reaction rate and efficiency, as well as poor selectivity, have limited its further development. The low solubility of CO2 in an aqueous solution is one of the main factors that limit the reaction rate and selectivity of the electroreduction of CO2 (ERC) at a high overpotential. In this study, an organic additive containing an -NH2 group (methyl carbamate, MC) was incorporated into the ERC electrolyte for the first time. By utilizing the affinity interaction between a Lewis acid (the -NH3+ group formed by protonation of the -NH2 group) and a Lewis base (CO2), the ERC reaction rate was increased by 17%, and the faradaic efficiency for the production of CH4 reached 81.6%, which represented a large increase of 34% and surpassed that of most reported Cu electrodes. Furthermore, the partial current density for the production of CH4 was 31 mA cm(-2) at -2.13 V (vs. RHE), which represents an increase of 30% in comparison with that in the blank system. In addition, the competitive hydrogen evolution reaction was substantially inhibited, and the decline in faradaic efficiency increased from 38.5% to 48.1% when the potential decreased gradually from -1.63 V to -1.98 V (vs. RHE). DFT calculations further indicate that the -NH3+ group can significantly promote the adsorption of CO* and CHO* on the Cu surface and increase the surface coverage of both intermediates. CHO* can be further stabilized by the -NH3+ group via the facilitation of partial electron transfer from Cu to C and the formation of H-bonds, which is favorable for further hydrogenation to form hydrocarbons. These results provide a simple and powerful way to increase the reaction rate and product selectivity of the reduction of CO2.\nDoi:10.1039_c9ta00039a", "label": [[958, 961, "CH4"], [970, 975, "Faradaic efficiency"], [50, 53, "Cu"], [593, 702, "surface/interface modification"]]}

However, most of these catalysts were investigated in conventional batch reactors at low current densities (<50 mA cm(-2)) due to the limitation of mass transport. Herein, a nondestructive strategy is proposed to transform nanostructured Cu catalysts into self-supported gas diffusion electrodes (GDEs), which enables the evaluation of the CO2 reduction performance in a flow cell at high current densities (up to 300 mA cm(-2)). Two typical self-supported GDEs were prepared through simply coating a hydrophobic microporous layer onto CuxO nanowires grown on Cu gauze. Both GDEs show high selectivity (>40%) for converting CO2 to multi-carbon products, e.g. C2H4 and ethanol, at commercially relevant current densities (>100 mA cm(-2)) and low overpotentials (h < 0.65 V). The GDEs are stable for more than 6 hours at current densities higher than 100 mA cm(-2). Moreover, the nondestructive method allows us to directly compare the product distributions of the nanostructured Cu catalysts in a batch reactor and flow reactor and to demonstrate the influence of the reaction environment and mass transport on the CO2RR. While the CO2RR in the H-cell shows high selectivity towards CO and formate, the reaction in the flow cell produces a greater amount of multi-carbon products due to the fast CO2 diffusion and high pH. Combined, the electrode design strategies and the experimental findings presented in this work are valuable for the development of other self-supported electrodes for practical applications.\nDoi:10.1039_c9ta06736a", "label": []}

The unsaturated coordination environment with a coordination number of 8.2 over the shell gold and curved interface determined this high electrocatalytic performance. Density functional theory calculations suggested that the double-dentate adsorption structure in the AuCu3@Au catalyst effectively improves the stability of the *COOH intermediate. The density of states indicates that the introduction of Cu causes the d-band-centre of AuCu3@Au to move toward the Fermi level, directly bonding with *COOH.

Different Ni thicknesses on Cu2O were achieved by varying the time of chronopotentiometric deposition of Ni. Electrochemical CO2 reduction was carried out at -0.89 V and -1.89 V vs. RHE, and it was found that formate and CO were the two major products.

The Cu-nanoplate catalyst exhibits 24 times increase in faradaic efficiency (FEC2) compared with the Cu-planar catalyst. The reaction mechanism is studied byin situRaman and density functional theory (DFT) calculations. The superior selectivity of the Cu-nanoplate catalyst for C2 products originates from the higher surface roughness and abundance of Cu (200) facets. The finding is an important development towards the fabrication of efficient catalysts with exclusively higher selectivity for multicarbon products.\nDoi:10.1039_d0cy00487a", "label": [[79, 86, "Cu"], [448, 478, "structure control"], [521, 532, "C2+"]]}

Structural and compositional data including crystallite size were obtained while performing high current density (up to 200 mA cm(-2)) CO(2)reduction. On the silver catalysts at higher than 100 mA cm(-2)applied current density, a Ag-X contribution was found and is ascribed to Ag-O. For both silver and copper, the XAS experiments revealed that the crystallite size of theex situsamples is smaller than the samples during CO(2)reduction. Furthermore, metal particle size polydispersity was found in the silver catalysts by comparing the obtained coordination numbers with theoretical values.

However, the product distribution depends on the type of employed Cu surface, and hence, reaction mechanisms for such wide product distributions remain under debate. Here, we have employed density functional theory calculations to investigate the interaction between Cu surfaces with different levels of adsorption site coordination and several intermediates that could be present in the CO2 reduction towards CO, HCOOH, CH4, and CH3OH. We found that decreasing the adsorption site coordination strengthens the adsorption and interaction energies of all intermediates, but the magnitude of such a coordination effect is different from one adsorbate to another. Therefore, this effect leads to the prediction of coordination-dependent reaction pathways, e.g., HCOOH formation could happen through COOH (HCOO) intermediates if the reaction proceeds on step (terrace) sites of a Cu(533) surface. Moreover, we have tested if different solvation corrections could change the reaction pathways, onset potentials, or potential-determining steps for a given product. Interestingly, we found that a change in the solvation correction makes the reaction pathway predicted solely with thermodynamic arguments to be in better agreement with experimental findings, but this effect does not occur for surfaces with lower coordination sites. Thus, it could indicate the importance of kinetic arguments to explain some inconsistencies between thermodynamic pathways and experimental observations.\nDoi:10.1039_d0cy02337j", "label": []}
{"id": 3895, "data": "Title:Insights into the carbon balance for CO2 electroreduction on Cu using gas diffusion electrode reactor designs\nAbstract:In this work, the carbon balance during high-rate CO2 reduction in flow electrolyzers was rigorously analyzed. The CO2 consumption at gas-diffusion electrodes due to electrochemical conversion and reaction with OH- at the electrode/electrolyte interface leads to a substantial reduction in the volumetric flowrate of gas flow out of the electrolyzer, especially when highly concentrated alkaline electrolytes and elevated current densities are utilized, which is primarily due to an elevated pH at cathode/electrolyte interface. Without considering the CO2 consumption, the faradaic efficiencies for major gas products could be significantly overestimated during high current density CO2 reduction conditions, particularly in the case of high pH electrolyte. In addition, a detailed carbon balance path is elucidated via a two-step procedure of CO2 reaction with OH- at the cathode/electrolyte interface and subsequent CO2 generation at the anode/electrolyte interface caused by a relatively low pH in the vicinity of the anode. Based on the proposed two-step carbon balance path, a systematic exploration of gases released in the anolyte reveals the transformation of a HCO3- or OH- catholyte to a CO32- catholyte, which was further confirmed by pH measurements.\nDoi:10.1039_d0ee00047g", "label": []}

The composite catalyst PCN-222(Cu)/C displays better activity and selectivity (eta = 450 mV, FEHCOOH = 44.3%, j = 3.2 mA cm(-2)) than PCN-224(Cu)/C (eta = 450 mV, FEHCOOH = 34.1%, j = 2.4 mA cm(-2)) for the CO2 reduction to HCOOH in the range of -0.7--0.9 V (vs. RHE) due to its higher BET surface area, CO2 uptake, and a larger pore diameter. It is interesting that PCN-224(Cu)/C displays better performance in the range of -0.4--0.6 V (vs. RHE) due to its greater heat of adsorption, Q(st) and a higher affinity for CO2 molecule, which could promote the capture of CO2 onto the exposed active sites.

Here, we directly monitored CO2RR intermediates by employing time-resolved attenuated total reflection-surface enhanced infrared absorption spectroscopy (ATR-SEIRAS), with particular attention to the C-1 and C2+ pathways beyond the formation of *CO. Electrodeposited Cu and Cu(OH)(2)-derived Cu were synthesized, and subsequently employed as a C-1 and C2+ activating catalyst and C2+ activating catalyst, respectively. For the first time, a kinetically linked dimer intermediate (*OCCO) was observed and identified as the C2+ path triggering intermediate. The ATR-SEIRAS results suggest that C-C coupling occurs exclusively by CO dimerization toward *OCCO, without the participation of *CHO, which is an intermediate for CH4 production. In the real-time measurements, CO dimerization occurred concurrently with CO adsorption (similar to 5 s), while proton-coupled reduction toward *CHO has slower kinetics (similar to 30 s). We demonstrated that the sites showing a high vibrational frequency of *CO on the fragmented Cu surface are the potential active sites for the fast dimerization of CO.

However, fundamental understanding of Cu-MEAs is still limited compared to the wealth of knowledge available for aqueous-electrolyte Cu systems. Physics-based modeling can assist in the transfer of knowledge from aqueous to vapor-fed systems by deconvoluting the impacts of various physical processes and accelerating the optimization of Cu-MEAs.

Our results reveal nonuniformity of product distribution in the catalyst layer, allowing us to explore catalyst-layer properties as design parameters for increasing the energy efficiency of C(2+)product formation. We discuss multiphase flow and water-management issues and show how membrane properties, specifically the electro-osmotic coefficient, affect the efficacy of feeding liquid water to hydrate the membrane.

These problems are even more severe for charged molecules, not only resulting in unsatisfactory performance, but also leading to misleading evaluation of charged functionalities. In this work, methylation of cobalt(ii) tetraamino phthalocyanine (CoTAPc) transforms its electron-donating amino groups into electron-withdrawing quaternary ammonium cations, which favor the formation of *COOH intermediate and the desorption of *CO; this is conducive to a 130% increase of the current density for the CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR). However, the catalysts leach severely; consequently, the current density decays rapidly. To resolve this dilemma, we developed an in situ functionalization strategy by first covalently grafting CoTAPc onto carbon nanotubes via a diazo-reaction, followed by a complete methylation reaction. This is conducive to a 700% increase in CO partial current density compared to that of a physically mixed sample at -0.72 V vs. RHE with highly stable currents. In a flow cell, this covalently immobilized structure delivers an industrially relevant current density of 239 mA cm(-2), CO selectivity of 95.6% at 590 mV overpotential and very low molecular loading of 0.069 mg cm(-2).

A dynamic hydrogen bubble template approach is applied to electrodeposit a binary PdCu alloy foam yielding a nominal bulk composition of 9 at% Pd and 91 at% Cu (denoted as Pd9Cu91). The material is further modified by means of thermal annealing (12 h at 200 degrees C in air), which completely transforms the as-prepared metallic Pd(9)Cu(91)alloy foam into its oxidic state. The ultimate catalyst activation is achieved by subsequent reduction (at -0.65 Vvs.RHE for 45 min) of the oxidic precursors (composite of Cu2O, CuO, and CuPdO3) into metallic state, as indicated byoperandoRaman spectroscopy. Identical location scanning electron microscopy (IL-SEM) analysis, carried out prior to and after the activation treatments, demonstrates significant morphological alterations of the Pd(9)Cu(91)foam on the nm length scale, which go along with a phase segregation into nm-range Pd-rich and Cu-rich domains that helps to increase the PrOH selectivity. Time-dependent ICP-MS analyses of the electrolyte solution, carried out during the catalyst activation, demonstrate preferential (rapid) Cu dissolution followed by (slow) Cu redeposition on the catalyst surface. These processes are found to be superimposed on the actual oxide reduction. A two-fold selectivity of PrOH was observed over ethanol (EtOH). The excellent long-term stability of the activated Pd(9)Cu(91)foam catalyst is rationalized by the full suppression of the C1 hydrocarbon (methane) pathway. The improved product selectivity towards the highly valuable C3 alcohol is rationalized by an efficient and concerted spillover of chemisorbed carbon monoxide (*CO) and atomic hydrogen (*H) species from the Pd-rich domains to the activated Cu-rich domains of the oxide-derived Pd(9)Cu(91)foam catalyst where the C-C coupling and subsequent hydrogenation processes take place to form the targeted oxygenate product.\nDoi:10.1039_d0gc01636e", "label": [[270, 280, "propanol"], [83, 87, "Cu-M"], [88, 94, "alloy"], [299, 387, "Faradaic efficiency"]]}

Here, we prepare two types of copper molybdate, CuMoO4 and Cu3Mo2O9, and electrochemically investigate them for water splitting and CO2 reduction. Our findings show that Cu3Mo2O9 is a better electrocatalyst for full water splitting compared to CuMoO4.

Contrary to what has been reported in the literature for polished copper surfaces, demonstrating a linear decrease in the faradaic efficiency (FE) as a function of decreasing partial pressure, the (FE) and partial current density of both ethylene and methane are improved when the CO(2)partial pressure is decreased below 1 atm, and an optimized ethylene efficiency of similar to 45% is achieved in the range of similar to 0.4-similar to 0.6 atm at -1.1 Vvs.RHE. Such optimum in ethylene FE, ranging from similar to 10-45%, is obtained at a variety of applied voltages (-0.7 to -1.1 Vvs.RHE), but only at relatively low concentrations of KHCO(3)of less than 0.25 M. Since a low KHCO(3)concentration induces only a low buffer capacity, we conclude that a rise of local pH induced by a decreased CO(2)partial pressure explains improved selectivity towards ethylene. If the CO(2)partial pressure decreases below similar to 0.4 atm, not only the availability of CO(2)limits ethylene selectivity, but also a fall in local pH, associated with the decreasing partial current density in formation of ethylene. Calculations of local concentrations of CO(2)and the pH corroborate these hypotheses. These findings contribute to, and substantiate the current understanding of the significant role of local pH conditions on the selectivity of CO(2)electroreduction products, and suggest high ethylene selectivity over oxide derived Cu electrodes can be obtained for diluted CO(2)feed compositions if the electrolyte has a relatively low buffer capacity.\nDoi:10.1039_d0se00865f", "label": []}

Herein, we introduced a novel three-dimensional electrode composed of mesoporous carbon-embedded copper nanoparticles that are capable of selectively producing formic acid and short-chain hydrocarbons at low overpotentials. The mesoporous electrocatalyst was synthesized from a facile and one-pot green chemistry process using bio-sourced Tannin mimosa (polymeric flavonoids) acting as both reducing agent and carbon precursor.

The catalyst was fabricated by the electrodeposition of a Cu-Ni alloy onto titanium nitride (TiN) nanoparticles on carbon mesh. The use of TiN on carbon as a solid support greatly enhances both the CO2 reduction and O-2 evolution catalytic activity of the Cu-Ni particles.

In this configuration, this device produced 19.1% CO and 6.7% formate as products of the CO2RR. Through cyclic voltammetry studies, it was found that Cu-Ni preferentially deposits on TiN as compared to bare carbon, thus allowing for more Cu-Ni to be uniformly deposited, which significantly enhances catalysis.

As a CO2 reduction catalyst, the hierarchically nanoporous copper integrated with vanadium oxide can achieve a 30.1% faradaic efficiency for CO2-to-ethanol production and an ethanol partial current density of -16 mA cm(-2) at -0.62 V vs. RHE, corresponding to a 4-fold increase in activity compared to bare nanoporous Cu.

The ethylene pathway is shown to be favored on Cu-X surfaces doped with strong oxygen affinity atoms, such as boron. Ethane selectivity is generally boosted by Cu-X, whereas ethanol generation is suppressed by non-metal doping on Cu surfaces.

Density functional theory (DFT) based computational results suggest that the decrement in the H binding energy and blockage of step edge atoms (which are the most active sites for the HER) by pyridine molecules are the reasons for selective suppression of the HER activity on the copper surface after pyridine functionalization. Further, an insignificant decrease in CO binding is the reason behind the lack of suppression of the CO2RR activity.

In this work, cuprous oxide (Cu2O) was supported on N-doped flexible roughed graphite paper (NGP) to fabricate Cu2O/NGP self-supporting electrocatalysts for CO(2)RRs by electrodeposition and heat treatment. In the Cu2O/NGP electrocatalyst, NGP acted as a current collector and conducting channel, which can effectively transfer electrons from the active sites of Cu2O to NGP, and thus, enhance the catalytic performance of Cu2O/NGP for CO(2)RRs. The overall Faradaic efficiency of Cu2O/NGP for CO(2)RRs reached 96% at -0.9 V vs. reversible hydrogen electrode, of which 35% originated from yielding ethylene (C2H4), suggesting its high activity and C2H4 selectivity. Furthermore, the excellent stability of Cu2O/NGP over 10 h made it preferable as an effective electrocatalyst for CO(2)RRs. The good electrocatalytic performance could be attributed to the unique self-supporting structure and the synergetic effect between Cu2O and NGP.\nDoi:10.1039_d1cy01099a", "label": [[133, 137, "C2H4"], [28, 33, "CuOx"], [872, 875, "Faradaic efficiency"], [317, 400, "composite"]]}

Ethylene is an economically desired product, and Cu is the only cathode that produces C2H4 at reasonable faradaic efficiencies. Altering the binding strength of the key intermediate (CO2-) to favor the reaction pathway to ethylene offers an opportunity to enhance its selectivity further. We explore the influence of ionic liquid cations on ethylene/CO2RR and hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) activities on polycrystalline Cu. Alkylated imidazolium, pyrazolium, pyrrolidinium, and ammonium tetrafluoroborates were chosen because of their range of Bader charges on their N atom(s) and pK(a) values. Among all cations, the tetraethylammonium cation with moderate Bader charge on N and high pK(a) of hydration showed the highest ethylene/CO2RR and lowest HER activities, respectively. From density functional theory calculations, it is concluded that the moderate stabilization of the critical intermediate (*COO-) and the decrease in hydrogen binding energy are the reasons for the enhancement of ethylene/CO2RR and suppression of HER activities, respectively.\nDoi:10.1039_d1cy01584b", "label": []}

Herein, we report the production of pure acetate (aside from H-2) from a CO2RR with a novel polymeric Cu-ligand (pyridinic N and carbonyl group) complex (p-CuL) core-shell microsphere synthesized by a facile thermal-polymerization of urea and a Cu-urea complex. The highly selective reduction of CO2 to acetate, without any detectable gas products besides H-2, is enabled by the unique co-coordination of pyridinic N and C-O with copper whose chemical state is between +1 and +2 and the porous 3D core that is kinetically favorable for the acetate product. The maximal faradaic efficiency of acetate of similar to 64% is attained at -0.37 V vs. RHE in a 0.5 M KHCO3 electrolyte, and H-2 evolution is much suppressed. In the process of the CO2RR to acetate, the Cu(ii)-carbonyl coordination remains while Cu delta+-ligand active sites are reduced to Cu(i). In addition, the highly selective acetate production is favored by the p-CuL core-shell microsphere for the adsorption of some important intermediates of CO2 reduction and their dimerization and further e(-)/h(+) reduction, as seen from the distinctly increased C-O and -OH groups in the O K-edge X-ray absorption spectrum (XAS) of p-CuL after the CO2RR.\nDoi:10.1039_d1gc01464a", "label": [[50, 57, "CH3COOH"], [688, 750, "atomic level dispersion"], [927, 930, "Faradaic efficiency"], [405, 497, "Cu-MOF"]]}

The results show that the presence of alkali metal cations can notably change CO2 electroreduction reaction pathways, activity, and product selectivity. Alkali metal cations with different atomic sizes can lead to differences in the reduction pathway of CO2 into CH4. Barriers to the CO formation pathway as the rate-determining step in CO2 electroreduction to C-1 products on clean Cu(111) surfaces are significantly decreased in the presence of alkali metal cations, thus enhancing the CO2 electroreduction activity. The Na cation with a smaller atomic size is more favorable for CO formation, which is in agreement with experimental observations. The enhanced CO2 electroreduction activity on alkali metal cation-promoted Cu electrodes may be attributed to the decreased limiting potential of the potential-limiting step. The origin of alkali metal promotion effects on CO2 electroreduction has been revealed. The difference in the geometric configuration may be the physical origin of the promoter effect. The electron structure analyses showed that significantly more electrons are transferred to adsorbed CO2 molecules on alkali metal cation-promoted Cu(111) surfaces, resulting in the formation of the anion radical (CO2-)-C-center dot and explaining why CO formation is more facile. More distorted CO2 and more electron transfer to CO2 on the Na cation-promoted Cu(111) surface explain why CO formation is more favorable than that in the presence of the Cs cation. The difference in the promotion mechanism of alkali metals may lead to different initial CO2 electroreduction activities where Na is regarded as an electron donor, whereas Cs with a larger atomic size is an effective electron acceptor.\nDoi:10.1039_d1nj03009d", "label": []}

However, different morphologies and structures of TiO2 supports can be obtained through various methods, leading to the discrepant electrocatalytic properties of CuO/TiO2. In this paper, three supports, named dense TiO2, TiO2 nanotube and TiO2 nanofiber, were applied to synthesize CuO/TiO2 electrodes by thermal decomposition, and the performances of the electrocatalysts were studied. Results show that the main product of the three electrocatalysts was ethanol, but the electrochemical efficiency and reaction characteristics are obviously different. The liquid product of CuO/Dense TiO2 is pure ethanol, however, the current efficiency is rather low owing to the higher resistance of the TiO2 film. CuO/TiO2 nanotube shows high conductivity and ethanol can be synthesized at low overpotential with high current efficiency, but the gas products cannot be restricted. CuO/TiO2 nanofiber has a larger specific surface area and more active sites, which is beneficial for CO2 reduction, and the hydrogen evolution reaction can be evidently restricted.

Bimetallic combinations of Cu with other metals have been investigated with the goal of steering selectivity via creating a tandem pathway through the CO intermediate or by changing the surface electronic structure. Here, we demonstrate a facile cation exchange method to synthesize Ag/Cu electrocatalysts for CO2 reduction using Cu sulfides as a growth template. Beginning with Cu2-xS nanosheets (C-nano-0, 100 nm lateral dimension, 14 nm thick), varying the Ag+ concentration in the exchange solution produces a gradual change in crystal structure from Cu7S4 to Ag2S, as the Ag/Cu mass ratio varies from 0.3 to 25 (CA-nano-x, x indicating increasing Ag fraction). After cation exchange, the nanosheet morphology remains but with increased shape distortion as the Ag fraction is increased. Interestingly, the control (C-nano-0) and cation exchanged nanosheets have very high faradaic efficiency for producing formate at low overpotential (-0.2 V vs. RHE). The primary effect of Ag incorporation is increased production of C2+ products at -1.0 V vs. RHE compared with C-nano-0, which primarily produces formate. Cation exchange can also be used to modify the surface of Cu foils. A two-step electro-oxidation/sulfurization process was used to form Cu sulfides on Cu foil (C-foil-x) to a depth of a few 10 s of microns. With lower Ag+ concentrations, cation exchange produces uniformly dispersed Ag; however, at higher concentrations, Ag particles nucleate on the surface. During CO2 electroreduction testing, the product distribution for Ag/Cu sulfides on Cu foil (CA-foil-x-y) changes in time with an initial increase in ethylene and methane production followed by a decrease as more H-2 is produced. The catalysts undergo a morphology evolution towards a nest-like structure which could be responsible for the change in selectivity. For cation-exchanged nanosheets (CA-nano-x), pre-reduction at negative potentials increases the CO2 reduction selectivity compared to tests of as-synthesized material, although this led to the aggregation of nanosheets into filaments. Both types of bimetallic catalysts are capable of selective reduction of CO2 to multi-carbon products, although the optimal configurations appear to be metastable.\nDoi:10.1039_d1ra03811g", "label": [[1166, 1174, "HCOOH"], [586, 597, "CuSx"], [634, 702, "structure control"]]}

Current success is mainly around monohydric alcohols, such as methanol and ethanol. There exist few reports on converting CO2 or CO to higher-valued diols such as ethylene glycol (EG; (CH2OH)(2)). The challenge to producing diols lies in the requirement to retain two oxygen atoms in the compound.

This results in selective electroreduction of CO2 or CO to diols. Density Functional Theory (DFT) computations highlight that the unique spatial-confinement induced by Cu-DAN is crucial to selectively generating EG through a new reaction pathway. This structure promotes C-C coupling with a decreased reaction barrier. Following C-C coupling the structure facilitates EG production by (1) retaining oxygen and promoting the *COH-CHO pathway, which is a newly identified pathway toward ethylene glycol production; and, (2) suppressing the carbon-oxygen bond breaking in intermediate *CH2OH-CH2O and boosting hydrogenation to EG.

It is caused by the reconstruction of Cu nanoparticles during electrochemical CO2 reduction and the unrevealed effect of capping ligands covering the Cu surface. We show that the C2+ selectivity and morphological evolution of Cu nanoparticles largely depend on the density of the capping ligand, tetradecylphosphonate (TDP). Ultraviolet-ozone pre-treatment of Cu nanoparticles reduced the density of TDP. Desorption of the remaining ligands was expedited within 3 h of the CO2 reduction process, and the concurrent aggregation of NPs formed bare Cu clusters. The increased C2+ selectivity of >50% faradaic efficiency revealed that the existing grain boundaries of Cu clusters promoted CO dimerization to produce C2+ materials. Despite similar cluster formation, Cu nanoparticles without ultraviolet-ozone treatment showed poor C2+ selectivity, suggesting that the remaining TDP, half of the original concentration, passivated the grain boundaries. Further the morphological transformation of Cu did not increase C2+ selectivity even after 20 h of the reaction.\nDoi:10.1039_d1ta01862k", "label": [[118, 120, "Cu"], [931, 1025, "structure control"], [873, 876, "C2+"], [893, 896, "Faradaic efficiency"]]}

Further density functional theory calculations indicate that the synergy between Fe-Cu diatoms causes rapid charge transfer and effectively adjusts the position of the d-band center, which reduces the energy barriers for *COOH formation and *CO desorption.

However, to achieve a high current density at a desired CO/H-2 ratio is still a great challenge although it is extremely important in practical applications.

For a Cu foam material which has been previously characterized regarding electrochemical properties and product spectrum, 129 operando spectra are reported, covering the spectral range from 250 to 3300 cm(-1).

Here, we develop a lattice KMC approach for electrocatalytic CO2 reduction. The work is motivated by a prior experimental report that performed electroreduction of a mixed feed of (CO2)-C-12 and (CO)-C-13 on Cu; differences in the C-13 content of C2 products ethylene and ethanol (& UDelta;C-13) were interpreted as evidence of site selectivity. The lattice KMC model considers the effect of surface diffusion on this system. In the limit of infinitely fast diffusion (mean-field approximation), the key intermediates (CO)-C-12* and (CO)-C-13* would be well mixed on the surface and no evidence of site selectivity could have been observed. Using a simple two-site model and adapting a previously reported microkinetic model, we assess the effects of diffusion on the relative isotope fractions in the products using the estimated surface diffusion rate of CO* from literature reports. We find that the size of the active sites and the total surface adsorbate coverage can have a large influence on the values of & UDelta;C-13 that can be observed. & UDelta;C-13 is less sensitive to the CO* diffusion rate as long as it is within the estimated range. We further offer possible methods to estimate surface distribution of intermediates and to predict intrinsic selectivity of active sites based on experimental observations. This work illustrates the importance of considering surface diffusion in the study of electrochemical CO2 reduction to multi-carbon products.

We describe here an electrodeposition strategy for preparing highly dispersed, ultrafine metal nanoparticle catalysts on an electroactive polymeric film including nanoalloys of Cu and Pd. Compared with nanoCu catalysts, which are state-of-the-art catalysts for CO2 reduction to hydrocarbons, the bimetallic CuPd nanoalloy catalyst exhibits a greater than twofold enhancement in Faradaic efficiency for CO2 reduction to methane. The origin of the enhancement is suggested to arise from a synergistic reactivity interplay between Pd-H sites and Cu-CO sites during electrochemical CO2 reduction. The polymer substrate also appears to provide a basis for the local concentration of CO2 resulting in the enhancement of catalytic current densities by threefold.

Albeit being more pronounced on nanostructured electrodes, the studies of mass transport for CO2 reduction have yet been limited to planar electrodes. We report here the development of a mass transport model for the electroreduction of CO2 on Cu nanowire electrodes. Fed with the experimental data from electrocatalytic studies, the local concentrations of CO2, HCO3-, CO32- and OH- on the nanostructured electrodes are calculated by solving the diffusion equations with spatially distributed electrochemical reaction terms incorporated. The mass transport effects on the catalytic activity and selectivity of the Cu nanowire electrocatalysts are thus discussed by using the local pH as the descriptor. The established correlations between the electrocatalytic performance and the local pH shows that, the latter does not only determine the acid-base reaction equilibrium, but also regulates the mass transport and reaction kinetics. Based on these findings, the optimal range of local pH for CO2 reduction is discussed in terms of a fine balance among the suppression of hydrogen evolution, improvement of C-2 product selectivity and limitation of CO2 supply.

Here we report a Cu/pyrenyl-graphdiyne (Pyr-GDY) composite catalyst, in which Cu2O and CuO NPs were in-situ formed and embedded in the matrix of a two-dimensional (2D) Pyr-GDY, during the synthesis of 2D Pyr-GDY using monolayer graphene covered Cu foil as a template, and copper acetate as a coupling catalyst. Cu2O and CuO NPs in Cu/Pyr-GDY can be electrochemically reduced to cubic metallic CuNPs to get Cu/Pyr-GDY-R electrocatalyst, with the average size of metallic Cu NPs being 42 nm. The Cu/Pyr-GDY-R on Cu foil can be directly used as a highly efficient electrocatalyst for CO2-to-formate conversion in a CO2-saturated 0.1 M KHCO3 electrolyte, with a formate Faradaic efficiency (FEformate) as high as 95% (at -1.2 V vs reversible hydrogen electrode), far superior to that of Pyr-GDY-free Cu NPs (with a FEformate of only 29%). The key reaction intermediate of HCOO* during CO2-to-formate conversion was identified by in situ Raman spectroscopy. The results of density functional theory calculations revealed that the Pyr-GDY support can decrease the reaction free energy for the adsorption of HCOO* on Cu site, due to the electron transfer from metallic Cu NPs to conjugated diacetylene groups in 2D Pyr-GDY support, which leads to the high selectivity for formate over hydrogen production.\nDoi:10.1088_2053-1583_ac217b", "label": [[7, 42, "Cu/C"], [91, 98, "HCOOH"], [989, 1037, "Faradaic efficiency"], [297, 347, "composite"]]}

Copper (Cu) is one of the few electrocatalysts that can convert CO(2)to higher-order hydrocarbons. We report the CO2RR on polycrystalline Cu from 5 degrees C to 45 degrees C as a function of electrochemical potential. Our result shows that selectivity shifts toward CH(4)at low temperature and H(2)at high temperature at the potential values between -0.95 V and -1.25 V versus reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE). We analyze the activation energy for each product and discuss the possible underlying mechanism based on their potential dependence. The activation barrier of CH(4)empirically obeys the Butler-Volmer equation, while C(2)H(4)and CO show a non-trivial trend. Our result suggests that the CH(4)production proceeds via a classical electrochemical pathway, likely the proton-coupled electron transfer of surface-saturated COad, while C(2)H(4)is limited by a more complex process, likely involving surface adsorbates. Our measurement is consistent with the view that the adsorbate-adsorbate interaction dictates the C(2+)selectivity.\nDoi:10.1115_1.4046552", "label": []}

These hybrid nanosheets with Cu(0)-enriched surface behave like noble metal nanocatalysts in both air stability and catalysis. Uniquely, Cu(0) within the nanosheets is stable against air oxidation for months because of the presence of formate on their surface. With the presence of atomically thick ultrastable Cu nanosheets, the hybrid Cu/Ni(OH)(2) nanosheets display both excellent activity and selectivity in the electroreduction of CO2 to CO. At a low overpotential of 0.39 V, the nanosheets provide a current density of 4.3 mA/cm(2) with a CO faradaic efficiency of 92%. No decay in the current is observed for more than 22 hours.

Combination of the stripping-type and rotating ring-disk voltammetric approaches has led to the observation that, regardless the overlapping reduction phenomena, the reduction of carbon dioxide at copper catalyst is, indeed, operative and coexists with hydrogen evolution reaction. Using the fundamental concepts of surface electrochemistry and analytical voltammetry, the reaction products (thrown onto the platinum ring electrode) could be considered and identified as adsorbates (on Pt) under conditions of the stripping-type oxidation experiment. Judging from the potentials at which the stripping voltammetric peaks appear in neutral CO2-saturated KHCO3 (pH 6.8), formic acid or carbon monoxide seem to be the most likely reaction products or intermediates. The proposed methodology also permits correlation between the CO2 electroreduction products and the potentials applied to the disk electrode. By performing the comparative stripping-type voltammetric experiments in acid medium (HClO4 at pH 1) with the adsorbates of formic acid, ethanol and acetaldehyde (on Pt ring), it can be rationalized that, although C2H5OH or CH3CHO are very likely CO2-reduction electroactive products, formation of some HCOOH, CH3OH or even CO cannot be excluded.\nDoi:10.1134_S1023193517100135", "label": []}

As the flux of CO2 to the Cu electrode surface was increased by increasing CO2 pressure and/or by stirring, the main reduction product was changed in the order of H-2 --> hydrocarbons --> CO and/or HCOOH. On the other hand, the selectivity of the reduction products was changed in the order of CO and/or HCOOH --> hydrocarbons --> H-2 by increasing the current density. From these results, it was concluded that the balance between the flux of CO2 from the bulk solution to the electrode surface and the current density determines which reduction products are produced. Hydrocarbon formation was preferential when the current density was comparable to the maximum CO2 flux under given condition. The partial current density for maximum hydrocarbon formation occurred at 375 mA cm-2 under CO2 pressure at 30 atm.\nDoi:10.1149_1.2055067", "label": []}

The concentration of dissolved CO2 ([CO2]) and ratio of [CO2]/[K+] in the KHCO3 solution after bubbling with CO2 were studied to determine the relationship between KHCO3 concentration and CO2 reduction faradaic efficiency. The results suggest that high [CO2]/[K+] ratio in solutions with low KHCO3 concentration is probably a key factor to promote CO2 reduction faradaic efficiency. A model for the effect of [CO2]/[K+] ratio on CO2 reduction efficiency was also proposed. (C) 2017 The Electrochemical Society. All rights reserved.\nDoi:10.1149_2.0601709jes", "label": []}

In the present work, we have put forth a facile approach for the regeneration of aged CuO-Cu2O/In2O3 nanocomposite along with a possible mechanism for the regeneration of activity of aged catalysts towards electrochemical reduction by regaining their oxygen vacancies (V-o) defects concentration by ultra-violet (UV) light treatment.

By adding proper electrocatalysts, such as nanoporous copper (NPC) with an average ligament size of 37 +/- 6 nm, hydrocarbons could be produced at a relatively low overpotential. As the dealloying time increased to 156 h, the NPC was transformed into CuO nanosheet structure, which yielded larger electrochemical surface area (ECSA) and current density than the as-prepared NPC films. However, the Faraday efficiency (FE) of the major conversion product, formic acid (HCOOH), decreased from 29 to 8% when the nanosheet structure was used as electrocatalyst. On the other hand, the surface morphology of the NPC films remained similar while the average ligament size increased from 37 to 63 nm after a post-annealing treatment at 500 degrees C for 4 h. Both the current density and ECSA of this post-annealed NPC film were nearly 3 times higher than those of as-prepared NPC film, and the FE toward HCOOH increased from 29 to 45%.

However, this reaction requires an efficient electrocatalyst with high selectivity. In this study, a nanoporous copper (NPC) film with a ligament size of 35 +/- 6 nm was used as an electrocatalyst for CO2 reduction. The current density of the CO2 reduction reaction and the Faradaic efficiency (FE) of HCOOH are doubled with the use of NPC as an electrocatalyst compared to that of copper (Cu) foils.

In addition, the hydrophilicity of the NPC film is confirmed through water contact angle tests; it decreases from 133.64 degrees to 21.57 degrees after He plasma-jet treatment.

A calcination time of 3 h at 600 degrees C and a hydrogen treatment temperature of 280 degrees C were found to induce the highest FE to CO of 73% at these constant electrochemical conditions. Optimizing oxidation properties is discussed to likely affect porosity, favoring the CO2 gas distribution over the length of the fiber, and hence the CO2 reduction efficiency. Treatment in H-2 in the range of 250 to 300 degrees C is proposed to affect the content of residual (subsurface) oxygen in Cu, which leads to favorable properties on the nanoscale.\nDoi:10.3390_catal11050571", "label": [[42, 48, "Cu"], [107, 109, "CO"], [1201, 1204, "Faradaic efficiency"], [119, 139, "structure control"]]}

Sn is uniformly distributed on the Cu2O crystals showing a cube-within-cube structure, and CuSn alloy phase emerges at high Sn contents. The atomic ratio of Cu to Sn is found to be crucially important for the selectivity of the CO2 reduction reaction, and a ratio of 11.6 leads to the optimal selectivity for CO. This electrode shows a high current density of 47.2 mA cm(-2) for CO formation at -1.0 V vs. the reversible hydrogen electrode and also displays good CO selectivity of 80-90% in a wide potential range. In particular, considerable CO selectivity of 72-81% is achieved at relatively low overpotentials from 240 mV to 340 mV. During the long-term tests, satisfactory stability is observed for the optimal electrode in terms of both electrode activity and CO selectivity.

The effect of deposition current density and additives (DAT, DTAB, PEG) on the catalysts' structure was evaluated. The selectivity of the synthesized catalysts towards the production of CO was evaluated by analyzing the gaseous products obtained using the catalysts as cathodes in electroreduction tests.

Copper nanospheres, hemispherical microaggregates of nanowires, and shapeless structures were electrodeposited in the presence of dodecyltrimethylammonium bromide (DTAB), 3,5-diamino-1,2,4-triazole (DAT) and polyethylene glycol (PEG), respectively. The effect of the deposition current density on catalyst morphology was also observed and it was found to be additive-specific. DTAB nanostructured electrodes showed the highest selectivity towards CO production, probably attributable to a higher specific surface area. EDX and XPS analysis disclosed the presence of residual DAT and DTAB uniformly distributed onto the catalysts structure. No significant effects of electrodeposition current density and Cu(I)/Cu(II) ratio on the selectivity towards CO were found.

However, a bulky (hexagonal) structure with particle size in the range of 1-10 mu m was obtained from a high-Zn-concentration bath, whereas a fern-like dendritic structure was produced using a low Zn concentration. A larger particle size of Zn dendrites could also be obtained when Cu2+ ions were added to the high-Zn-concentration bath. The catalysts were tested in the electrochemical reduction of CO2 (CO2RR) using an H-cell type reactor under ambient conditions. Despite the different sizes/shapes, the CO2RR products obtained on the nanostructured Zn catalysts depended largely on their morphologies. All the dendritic structures led to high CO production rates, while the bulky Zn structure produced formate as the major product, with limited amounts of gaseous CO and H-2.

The XPS analyses revealed that the co-presence of ZnO and Al2O3 into the Cu-based catalyst stabilize the CuO crystalline structure and introduce basic sites on the ternary as-synthesized catalyst. In contrast, the as-prepared CuZn- and Cu-based materials contain a higher amount of superficial Cu-0 and Cu1+ species. The CuZnAl-catalyst exhibited enhanced catalytic performance for the CO and H-2 production, reaching a Faradaic efficiency (FE) towards syngas of almost 95% at -0.89 V vs. RHE and a remarkable current density of up to 90 mA cm(-2) for the CO2 reduction at -2.4 V vs. RHE. The physico-chemical characterizations confirmed that the pyramidal mesoporous structure of this material, which is constituted by a high pore volume and small CuO crystals, plays a fundamental role in its low diffusional mass-transfer resistance. The CO-productivity on the CuZnAl-catalyst increased at more negative applied potentials, leading to the production of syngas with a tunable H-2/CO ratio (from 2 to 7), depending on the applied potential.

It is known that the preparation of efficient catalysts for this transformation is the key factor that determines the yield of C2H4. In this study, we prepared 1-octyl-3-methylimidazole functionalized graphite sheets (ILGS) in a facile manner by the electro-exfoliation of pure graphite rod in an aqueous solution of 1-octyl-3-methylimidazolium chloride (OmimCl : H2O = 1 : 5, V/V) at 10 V. They were then dispersed in an aqueous solution of copper chloride and sodium citrate. Subsequent reduction with sodium borohydride led to the formation of a composite comprised of cuprous oxide supported on Omimfunctionalized graphite sheets (Cu2O/ILGS). This composite was found to be an efficient catalyst for the electroreduction of carbon dioxide to ethylene. The as-made materials were characterized by transmission electron microscopy (TEM), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), Raman spectroscopy, and X-ray diffraction (XRD). The TEM images showed that the ILGS were composed of multiple layers of graphene. The XRD pattern and Raman spectrum indicated that the surface of the ILGS possessed several defects. In the electro-exfoliation process, the defects in the ILGS were modified in situ by covalent bonding with Omim groups, which was also confirmed by XPS. The Cu2O nanoparticles with an average diameter of 5 nm were uniformly distributed on the surface of the ILGS because the Omim groups grafted to the graphite sheets acted as anchors and prevented their aggregation by the steric effect. The electrocatalytic activities of Cu2O/ILGS for CO2 reduction were measured at different voltages in 0.1 mol L-1 KHCO3 aqueous solution under ambient temperature and pressure. These experiments showed that the catalytic performance of the Cu2O/ILGS composite was determined by cuprous oxide, while the ILGS displayed nearly no catalytic activity in the electroreduction of carbon dioxide. The faradaic efficiency of hydrogen and carbon dioxide reduction products changed with the reaction time because of the reduction of Cu2O to Cu under the electroreduction conditions. The faradaic efficiency of ethylene was -14.8% at -1.3 V (versus reversible hydrogen electrode). The performance of Cu2O/ILGS in the catalytic electroreduction of carbon dioxide was attributed to the stabilization of the Cu2O nanoparticles by the nest-like microstructures in the Cu2O/ILGS composite.\nDoi:10.3866_PKU.WHXB201801263", "label": [[43, 47, "C2H4"], [54, 58, "CuOx"], [2329, 2334, "Faradaic efficiency"], [2385, 2587, "composite"]]}

However, the use of traditional fossil energy leads to high amounts of carbon dioxide emissions, causing severe greenhouse effects. This, in turn, triggers a series of environmental problems. Harnessing renewable energy such as solar energy, wind energy, and hydropower to replace the traditional energy sources is very urgent. Conversion CO2 into value-added fuels and chemicals could be a useful strategy to mitigate the current energy and environmental crisis. It is well known that Cu-based materials are good electrocatalysts for the electrochemical reduction of CO2 (ECR-CO2). However, they suffer from some disadvantages such as high overpotential and poor selectivity and durability. Therefore, the development of copper based electrocatalysts with high activity and selectivity is essential. Metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) materials that have the advantages of large specific surface area, tunable pore size and porosity, and highly dispersed unsaturated metal centers can be used as electrocatalysts for CO2 reduction or as precursors for further preparation of catalysts with excellent performance. Through thermal decomposition in an inert atmosphere, metal ions in MOF can be transformed into metal clusters, metal oxides, or even metal mono-atoms. Meanwhile, organic ligands are carbonized into porous carbon materials. The addition of some heteroatoms such as B, N, P, and S to carbon materials has also been shown to be effective in changing the electron state and coordination structure of the catalysts. These heteroatoms combine with carbon atoms to form a new active site, denoted as M-X-C (M is the central metal ion and X is the mixed heteroatom) to enhance the catalytic activity of the ECR-CO2. Herein, pre-synthesized Cu-NBDC MOF (a Cu-based MOF synthesized by using 2-aminoterephthalic acid (NBDC) as ligand) is used as a precursor to anchor Cu2O/Cu on nitrogen doped porous carbon (Cu2O/Cu@NC) by annealing at different temperatures. XPS analysis shows that the Cu-N content in Cu2O/Cu@NC decreases with increasing annealing temperature. Investigation of the ECR-CO2 reveals that Cu2O/Cu@NC can inhibit the HER more effectively compared to Cu2O/Cu@C, thereby improving the overall catalytic activity and multi-electron product selectivity of the ECR-CO2. While the Faradic efficiency of formate (FEformate) increases with increasing temperature, those of ethylene and methane (FEC2H4 and FECH4, respectively) decreases with increasing temperature. Specifically, upon annealing at 400 degrees C, the CO2 Faradic efficiency of Cu2O/Cu@NC-400 is higher than 86% (-1.4 to -1.6 V vs. RHE), including 20.4% of FEC2H4 (-1.4 V vs. RHE) and 23.9% of FECH4 (-1.6 V vs. RHE). By contrast, FECH4 (-1.6 V vs. RHE) in the presence of Cu2O/Cu@C-400 without nitrogen doping is only 2.33%, and no C2H4 is detected. These significant differences in the catalytic behavior can be attributed to the fact that Cu-N is conducive for the stable adsorption of the *CH2 intermediate during the ECR-CO2, inhibiting the evolution of H-2. These results indicate that the pathway of the ECR-CO2 and its performance can be effectivel regulated by complexing nitrogen with Cu motifs.\nDoi:10.3866_PKU.WHXB202006017", "label": [[2545, 2553, "HCOOH"], [2092, 2138, "structure control"], [2140, 2150, "Cu/C"]]}

However, combustion of nonrenewable resources leads to the release of large quantities of CO2, the primary greenhouse gas. Notably, the concentration of CO2 in the atmosphere is increasing annually at an astounding rate. Electrochemical CO2 reduction (ECR) to value-added fuels and chemicals using electricity from intermittent renewable energy sources is a carbon-neutral method to alleviate anthropogenic CO2 emissions. Despite the steady progress in the selective generation of C-1 products (CO and formic acid), the production of multi-carbon species still suffers from low selectivity and efficiency. As an ECR product, ethylene (C2H4) has a higher energy density than do C-1 species and is an important industrial feedstock in high demand. However, the conversion of CO2 to C2H4 is plagued by low productivity and large overpotential, in addition to the severe competing hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) during the ECR. To address these issues, the design and development of advanced electrocatalysts are critical. Here, we demonstrate fine-tuning of ECR to C(2)H(4 )by taking advantage of the prominent interaction of Cu with shape-controlled CeO2 nanocrystals, that is, cubes, rods, and octahedra predominantly covered with (100), (110), and (111) surfaces, respectively. We found that the selectivity and activity of the ECR depended strongly on the exposed crystal facets of CeO2. The overall ECR Faradaic efficiency (FE) over Cu/CeO2(110) (FE approximate to 56.7%) surpassed that of both Cu/CeO2(100) (FE approximate to 51.5%) and Cu/CeO2(111) (FE approximate to 48.4%) in 0.1 mol.L--(1) KHCO3 solutions with an H-type cell. This was in stark contrast to the exclusive occurrence of the HER over pure carbon paper, CeO2(100), CeO2(110), and CeO2(111). In particular, the FE toward C2H4 formation and the partial current density increased in the sequence Cu/CeO2(111) < Cu/CeO2(100) < Cu/CeO2(110) within applied bias potentials from -1.00 to -1.15 V (vs. the reversible hydrogen electrode), reaching 39.1% over Cu/CeO2(110) at a mild overpotential (1.13 V). The corresponding values for Cu/CeO2(100) and Cu/CeO2(111) were FEC2H4 approximate to 31.8% and FEC2H4 approximate to 29.6%, respectively. The C2H4 selectivity was comparable to that of many reported Cu-based electrocatalysts at similar overpotentials. Furthermore, the FE for C2H4 remained stable even after 6 h of continuous electrolysis. The superior ECR activity of Cu/CeO2(110) to yield C2H4 was attributed to the metastable (110) surface, which not only promoted the effective adsorption of CO2 but also remarkably stabilized Cu+, thereby boosting the ECR to produce C2H4. This work offers an alternative strategy to enhance the ECR efficiency by crystal facet engineering.\nDoi:10.3866_PKU.WHXB202009023", "label": [[40, 49, "C2H4"], [54, 85, "Cu-MOx"], [2226, 2231, "Faradaic efficiency"], [87, 119, "structure control"]]}

The direct reduction of carbonic acid on a steel surface is believed to be the cause of the higher corrosion rates of mild steel, as compared to that observed in strong-acid solutions with the same pH. However, in-depth quantitative analyses based on comprehensive mechanistic models, developed in recent years, have challenged this idea. In an attempt to provide explicit experimental evidence for the significance of direct reduction of carbonic acid in CO2 corrosion of mild steel, the charge transfer controlled cathodic currents in CO2 saturated solutions were investigated in the present study. The experiments were conducted on three different surfaces: Type 316L stainless steel, pure iron, and API 5L X65 mild steel, in order to examine the possible effect of alloying impurities on the kinetics and the mechanism of cathodic currents. The experimental polarization curves showed that at a constant pH, the charge transfer controlled cathodic currents did not increase with increasing partial pressure of CO2 from 0 bar to 5 bar. This confirmed that the direct carbonic acid reduction was not significant at the conditions covered in the present study, and its sole effect was to buffer the hydrogen ion concentration.\nDoi:10.5006_2792", "label": []}

Mass transfer from four different samples, with roughness values of 0.5 mu m, 6 mu m, 20 mu m, and 34 mu m, is measured using the limiting current technique for a range of rotational speeds in NaCl solutions saturated with N-2 at pH = 3 and 4. Comparison with available correlations for the Sherwood number in literature (which are independent of surface roughness and are either for specific or arbitrary roughness patterns) shows that H+ mass transfer only correlates well for particular levels of roughness and that their accuracy can be increased if a correlation is utilized which is a function of surface roughening. A new correlation for Sherwood number as a function of the Reynolds number, Schmidt number, and surface roughness is proposed which agrees well with the mass transfer observed from all of the rough surface cases considered for this particular roughness pattern. Complementary experiments in CO2 environments were used to assess the combined limiting current associated with H+ and H2CO3 reduction (with the latter occurring via the buffering effect and being associated with the slow CO2 hydration step). Although the increase in sample roughness clearly leads to an increase in the rate of H+ mass transfer, in the CO2 environments considered, surface roughness is found to have no significant influence on the limiting current contribution from H2CO3, which can therefore be determined from Vetter's equation across this range of operating conditions.\nDoi:10.5006_2552", "label": []}

It is found that Cu(II)-cyclam can catalyze CO2 reduction at the potential close to its thermodynamic value (0.75 V vs. Ag/AgCl) in tris-HCl buffer (pH 8.45) on a glassy carbon electrode. Cu(II)-cyclam, however, suffers from severe demetalation due to the insufficient stability of Cu(I)-cyclam. Cu(II)-PCB-cyclam and Cu(II)-PCB-TE2A are revealed to exhibit much less demetalation behavior, but poor CO2 reduction activities as well. The inferior electrocatalytic ability of Cu(II)-PCB-cyclam is ascribed to its redox potential that is too high for CO2 reduction, and that of Cu(II)-PCB-TE2A to the steric hindrance preventing facile contact with CO2 molecules. This study suggests that in addition to the redox potential and chemical stability, the stereochemical aspect has to be considered in designing efficient electrocatalysts for CO2 reduction.\nDoi:10.5229_JECST.2015.6.3.106", "label": []}

The combination of Pd with Cu also changed the stability of the catalyst. By using the bimetallic catalyst, stable reduction current was obtained in the long-term electrolysis while a monometallic Pd catalyst suffered from deactivation due to poisoning by CO. These improvements are attributable to the electrical interaction between Pd and Cu.

Herein,based on density functional theory calculations,we found that monolayer Co-BHT(BHT=benzenehexathiol) exhibits promising electrocatalytic activity in CO2 reduction to CH4.

Therefore, in-depth knowledge of the Cu catalyst surface and identification of the active species under reaction conditions aid in designing efficient Cu-based electrocatalysts. This progress report categorizes various Cu-based electrocatalysts into four main groups, namely metallic Cu, Cu alloys, Cu compounds (Cu + non-metal), and supported Cu-based catalysts (Cu supported by carbon, metal oxides, or polymers). The detailed mechanisms for the selective CO2RR are presented, followed by recent relevant developments on the synthetic procedures for preparing Cu and Cu-based nanoparticles. Herein, the potential link between the Cu surface and CO2RR performance is highlighted, especially in terms of the chemical states, but other significant factors such as defective sites and roughened morphology of catalysts are equally considered during the discussion of current studies of CO2RR with Cu-based electrocatalysts to fully understand the origin of the significant enhancement toward C-2 formation.

Herein, an excellent catalytic activity of a 2D copper (Cu)-based conductive MOF, copper tetrahydroxyquinone (Cu-THQ), is reported for aqueous CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR) at low overpotentials. It is revealed that Cu-THQ nanoflakes (NFs) with an average lateral size of 140 nm exhibit a negligible overpotential of 16 mV for the activation of this reaction, a high current density of approximate to 173 mA cm(-2) at -0.45 V versus RHE, an average Faradaic efficiency (F.E.) of approximate to 91% toward CO production, and a remarkable turnover frequency as high as approximate to 20.82 s(-1).

Several approaches including the fabrication of oxide-derived structures, atomic surface control, and the Cu+/Cu interfaces have been primarily used to produce ethanol from CO2. Here, a combined structure with Cu+ and high-facets as electrocatalysts is constructed by creating high-facets of wrinkled Cu surrounded by Cu2O mesh patterns. Using chemical vapor deposition graphene growth procedures, the insufficiently grown graphene is used as an oxidation-masking material, and the high-facet wrinkled Cu is simultaneously generated during the graphene growth synthesis. The resulting electrocatalyst shows an ethanol selectivity of 43% at -0.8 V versus reversible hydrogen electrode, which is one of the highest ethanol selectivity values reported thus far. This is attributed to the role of Cu+ in enhancing CO binding strength, and the high-facets, which favor C-C coupling and the ethanol pathway.

The nanowire morphology effect is linked to the increased local pH in the Cu nanowire arrays and a reaction scheme detailing the local pH-induced formation of C-2 products is also presented by a preferred CO dimerization pathway.\nDoi:10.1002_anie.201601282", "label": [[88, 91, "Cu"], [91, 106, "structure control"], [962, 974, "C2+"]]}

It is known that the morphology of the catalyst can modulate catalytic activity and selectivity, yet this remains a relatively underexplored area in electrochemical CO2 reduction. Here, we exploit the material tunability afforded by colloidal chemistry to establish unambiguous structure/property relations between Cu nanocrystals and their behavior as electrocatalysts for CO2 reduction. Our study reveals a non-monotonic size-dependence of the selectivity in cube-shaped copper nanocrystals. Among 24nm, 44nm and 63nm cubes tested, the cubes with 44nm edge length exhibited the highest selectivity towards CO2RR (80%) and faradaic efficiency for ethylene (41%).

In order to provide significant information about the role of oxygen in the electrochemical reduction of CO2 on Cu electrodes, the conditions of the surface structure and the composition of the Cu single crystal electrodes were controlled over time. This was achieved using pulsed voltammetry, since the pulse sequence can be programmed to guarantee reproducible initial conditions for the reaction at every fraction of time and at a given frequency. In contrast to the selectivity of CO2 reduction using cyclic voltammetry and chronoamperometric methods, a large selection of oxygenated hydrocarbons was found under alternating voltage conditions. Product selectivity towards the formation of oxygenated hydrocarbon was associated to the coverage of oxygen species, which is surface-structure- and potential-dependent.\nDoi:10.1002_anie.201706463", "label": []}

It has been proposed that a large fraction of the initial oxide can be surprisingly resistant to reduction, and these residual oxides play a crucial catalytic role. The stability of residual oxides was investigated by synthesizing O-18-enriched OD Cu catalysts and testing them for CO2R. These catalysts maintain a high selectivity towards C-2/C-3 products (ca. 60%) for up to 5 h in 0.1m KHCO3 at @ 1.0V vs. RHE. However, secondary-ion mass spectrometry measurements show that only a small fraction (< 1%) of the original O-18 content remains, showing that residual oxides are not present in significant amounts during CO2R.

Dynamic changes in the morphology and composition of Cucubes supported on carbon were monitored under potential control through electrochemical atomic force microscopy, X-ray absorption fine-structure spectroscopy and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy. Under reaction conditions, the roughening of the nanocube surface, disappearance of the (100) facets, formation of pores, loss of Cu and reduction of CuOx species observed were found to lead to a suppression of the selectivity for multi-carbon products (i.e. C2H4 and ethanol) versus CH4. A comparison with Cucubes supported on Cu foils revealed an enhanced morphological stability and persistence of Cu-I species under CO2RR in the former samples. Both factors are held responsible for the higher C-2/C-1 product ratio observed for the Cu cubes/Cu as compared to Cu cubes/C.

This paper describes the controllable construction of Cu-0-Cu+ sites derived from the well-dispersed cupric oxide particles supported on copper phyllosilicate lamella to enhance CO2ER performance. 20 % Cu/CuSiO3 shows the superior CO2ER performance with 51.8 % C2H4 Faraday efficiency at -1.1 V vs reversible hydrogen electrode during the 6 hour test. In situ attenuated total reflection infrared spectra and density functional theory (DFT) calculations were employed to elucidate the reaction mechanism. The enhancement in CO2ER activity is mainly attributed to the synergism of Cu-0-Cu+ pairs: Cu-0 activates CO2 and facilitates the following electron transfers; Cu+ strengthens *CO adsorption to further boost C-C coupling.

We have designed and synthesized a stable crystalline single-chain catalyst model system for electrochemical CO2RR, which involves four homomorphic one-dimensional chain-like compounds (Cu-PzH, Cu-PzCl, Cu-PzBr, and Cu-PzI).

Currently, CO2 electroreduction to methanol suffers from poor efficiency and low selectivity.

Copper nanoparticles (Cu NPs) are exceptionally advantageous for CO2RR to yield multielectron transfer chemical products such as ethylene and ethanol.

The imidazolium groups in the cationic ICTF not only can enhance CO2 capture capacity and lower the energetic barrier to activate CO2, but also the in situ formed N-heterocyclic carbenes (NHC) could stabilize Cu NPs to prevent their deactivation. Thus, the Cu/ICTF demonstrated higher selectivity (35 %) for the electroreduction of CO2 to ethylene with larger partial current density of ethylene (4.14 mA cm(-2)) over the unmodified neutral CTF stabilized Cu NPs (Cu/CTF) with 29 % Faradaic efficiency (FE) of ethylene and current density of 3.69 mA cm(-2).

The designed Cu-In catalyst (containing 1.55 wt % Cu) shows a high Faraday efficiency of 70 % for formate in CO(2)saturated 0.5 M NaHCO(3)electrolyte, which is much better than pure In (56 %).\nDoi:10.1002_cctc.202001135", "label": []}

The production of electrocatalytic CO2RR with copper metal shows low selectivity and mainly generates one-carbon (C-1) products, hindering its wide practical application. The use of copper (I) oxide (Cu2O) in electrocatalysis has attracted intense research attention because it can more efficiently produce C-2 products with high energy density such as ethylene (C2H4) and ethane (C2H6). We use an amino-modified Cu2O catalyst (NH2-Cu2O) for electrocatalytic CO2RR to obtain significantly increased production of the CO and C-2 products. Electrochemical in-situ infrared spectroscopy analysis was used to detect the presence of the *COOH and *CHO reaction intermediates. Density functional theory calculations showed that the amino (-NH2) modification reduces the free energy of the *CO ->*CHO reaction that is the rate-determining step in C2H4 production. Our results show that amino modification can promote the protonation of *CO and *CHO carbon-carbon coupling to produce C2H4. Thus, amino-modified copper-based catalysts are promising materials for application in electrocatalytic CO2RR to multi-carbon products.\nDoi:10.1002_cctc.202100620", "label": [[105, 113, "C2H4"], [117, 132, "CuOx"], [765, 914, "surface/interface modification"]]}

The electroreduction of CO2 on the catalyst is performed in an aqueous solution within a flow reactor. CO and HCOOH are the main products, with H-2 as a byproduct.

We demonstrate that an identical electrode covered with copper nanoparticles can yield either predominantly ethylene or methane, depending on the electrolyte concentration and applied CO2 pressure. Calculations of the pH near the electrode surface suggest that ethylene formation is favored by a relatively high (local) pH. Furthermore, the conditions leading to the formation of significant amounts of methane result in rapid deterioration of hydrocarbon production rates, whereas electrode performance in conditions favoring ethylene production can be sustained for hours. This study substantially alters the mechanistic interpretation of formation of ethylene over rough copper surfaces and implies that applied process conditions inducing pH variations near the electrode surface need to be taken into consideration.\nDoi:10.1002_celc.201402373", "label": []}

Here, the oxidation/reduction process is examined in detail. It is found that the faradaic efficiencies for both ethylene and ethanol are enhanced after oxidation/reduction cycling in the presence of halide anions. Specifically, cycling of the electrode in the presence of chloride, bromide, or fluoride anions allows for an ethylene faradaic efficiency of approximately 15.2 %, a factor of 1.5 higher than that for polycrystalline copper (at -1.0 V vs. RHE). The faradaic efficiency for ethanol is also enhanced from 2.65 to approximately 7.6 %. The effects of electrochemical oxidation/reduction with the chloride anion were investigated by using in situ Raman spectroscopy, and the changes in the surface morphology of copper were monitored by using SEM. Consistent with prior reports, it is observed that during the oxidation part of the cycle, anodic corrosion forms a Cu2O layer, which consists of cubical crystals of about 150 nm. During the reduction sweep, it is converted to metallic copper, which forms irregular Cu nanoparticles of around 20 nm in diameter. The enhancement in ethylene formation is presumably attributed to the formation of grain boundaries, which may serve as active sites.\nDoi:10.1002_celc.201600068", "label": [[109, 115, "Cu"], [635, 644, "C2H4"], [681, 687, "Faradaic efficiency"], [1379, 1480, "structure control"]]}

It is known that Cu nanoparticles show a better performance for CO2 electro-reduction than bulk Cu. However, the roles of the size and symmetry of the Cu clusters as well as the temperature in the CO2-reduction process remain elusive, which hinders the development of advanced catalysts. In this study, the density functional theory (DFT) method is applied to investigate these factors. We find that the decrease of icosahedron Cu clusters' size but the increase of truncated octahedron Cu clusters' size contributes to the selectivity of CO2 reduction. In addition, the symmetry of Cu clusters modulates the selectivity of CO2 reduction at room temperature: the (111)-like surfaces prefer to produce hydrocarbons but the synergistic effect between (100)- and (111)- like ones favors the formation of CO, which are in reasonable agreement with the experimental measurements that distinct products are detected on different Cu nanoparticles during CO2 reduction. We also note that the increase of temperature is favorable to CO production.

The combination of the results obtained by these different techniques allows the exclusion of different reduced forms of CO2, such as CO and (bi)carbonates, as possible carboxylation agents. Moreover, the results also indicate that electrochemical activation of the propylene oxide by ring opening is not the initial step for this reaction, as no product was detected when a current was not applied in presence of \"activated propylene oxide\" and CO2. Our results show that the reaction is initiated by the activation of CO2 to CO2.-, which then attacks the epoxide to form the cyclic carbonate.

In this work, distinct Cu, Cu2O, and CuO nanoparticles with similar particle size on active carbon are synthesized via carbonthermal reduction. Although all CuOx nanoparticles are reduced to metallic Cu during CO2ERR, their different initial valence states result in particle-size variations and different CO2ERR performances. Cu nanoparticles in Cu/C evolve into smaller particles, while those derived from Cu2O/C and CuO/C agglomerate into larger ones. The optimal CO production potential of CO drops with decreasing particle size and is as low as -0.7 V (vs. the eversible hydrogen electrode) on Cu/C. Furthermore, Cu nanoparticles in Cu/C expose much more active sites with higher electrochemical active area and stronger CO adsorption, which further promote C-C coupling to produce C2+ products while inhibiting competitive hydrogen evolution.\nDoi:10.1002_celc.202100913", "label": []}

Herein, the novel Au decorated Cu2O electrocatalysts were synthesized via the galvanic replacement reaction and the successive pre-reduction by linear voltammetry (LSV) method. In contrast to Cu2O, CO formation became dominant over HCOOH and H-2 on AuxCu2O, and a remarkably enhanced selectivity of C2H4 was obtained beyond -1.1 V vs. RHE. Among them, Au0.02Cu2O exhibited the highest Faraday efficiency (FE) of C2H4 of 24.4 % at -1.3 V vs. RHE, which was as high as 2 similar to 2.5 and 5 times of those on other two AuxCu2O and bare Cu2O, respectively. Meanwhile, it is demonstrated that the optimal ratio of Au/Cu was essential for effective sequential catalysis between Au and Cu2O to enhance C-C coupling. Furthermore, the effect of copper states resulting from different pre-reduction methods on the selectivity of C2H4 was explored. A half decrease of C2H4 FE was observed on HPR-Au0.02Cu2O (high potential reduced) relative to the LSV reduced Au0.02Cu2O, which was ascribed to the different content of Cu-0 and residual Cu+ in two catalysts.

Recently, we have described the realization of an electrochemical reactor based on the use of a Cu cathode for the CO2 electroreduction reaction. Here, three Cu electrodes were prepared by different techniques that generate different surface structures and morphologies. These three Cu cathodes, employed in the electrolysis cell, are compared in terms of Faradaic efficiency (FE) and product selectivity to a reference Cu foil electrode. The higher active surface area of these samples produced an improved total FE versus the Cu smooth plate. In terms of product selectivity, Cu electroplating onto a Cu foil enhanced HCOOK production strongly; the electrofaceting treatment of the Cu foil drove selectivity towards the production of CH4. In the third electrode, the deposition of Cu onto carbon cloth favors the formation of C2H4.\nDoi:10.1002_ente.201600044", "label": []}

Recent reports pointed out the superior performance of rough copper polycrystalline catalysts; however, reconstruction that takes place on such surfaces is under investigation.

A key issue in the design of electrochemical systems for the reduction of CO2 is the in situ identification of intermediate surface species aswell as reaction products. Copper electrodes, besides being used as cathodes in the electrochemical reduction of CO2, present surface-enhanced Raman scattering (SERS) when properly activated. In this sense, the electrochemical reduction of CO2 over a copper electrode in the room temperature ionic liquids 1-n-butyl-3-methyl imidazolium tetrafluoroborate (BMI.BF4) was investigated by cyclic voltammetry and by in situ SERS. The cyclic voltammetries have shown that the presence of CO2 on the BMI.BF4 anticipates the reduction of BMI+ to the corresponding carbene. Fourier-transform-SERS spectra excited at 1064nm and SERS spectra excited at 632.8nm have shown vibrational signals from adsorbed CO. These SERS results indicated that CO adsorbs on the copper surface at two different surface sites. The observation of a 2275 cm(-1) vibration in the SERS spectra also confirmed the presence of chemically adsorbed CO2. Other products of CO2 reduction in BMI.BF4, besides CO, were identified, including BMI carbene and the BMI-CO2 adduct. The SERS results also suggest that the presence of a thin film of Cu2O on the copper surface anticipates the reduction of CO2 to CO, an important component of syngas.

In this study, we demonstrate the dynamic structure change of Cu clusters on graphite-like carbon supports plays an important role in the multicarbon production by combining static calculations and ab-initio molecular dynamic simulations. The mobility of Cu clusters on graphite is attributed to the near-degenerate energies of various adsorption configurations, as the interaction between Cu atoms and surface C atoms is weaker than that of Cu-Cu bonds in the tight cluster form. Such structure change of Cu clusters leads to step-like irregular surface structures and appropriate interparticle distances, increasing the selectivity of multicarbon products by reducing the energy barriers of C-C coupling effectively. In contrast, the large ratio of edge and corner sites on Cu clusters is responsible for the increased catalytic activity and selectivity for CO and H-2 compared with Cu(100) surface, instead of hydrocarbon products like methane and ethylene. The detailed study reveals that the dynamic structure change of the catalysts results in roughened surface morphologies during catalytic reactions and plays an essential role in the selectivity of CO2 electro-reduction, which should be paid more attention for studies on the reaction mechanisms.\nDoi:10.1002_inf2.12229", "label": []}

The electrodes were prepared as follows: (A) only ultrasonic cleaning in acetone; (B) oxidation in air; (C) exposure to argon plasma. The electrolysis time was 3 h at a given potential. With electrode A, on increasing the potential in a negative direction the amount of CH4 increased, accompanied by a decrease in the amounts of H-2 and CO, and the SP value was positive and shifted in a more positive direction, the TPPE activity increased and in the O1s XPS spectra a peak assigned to adsorbed oxygen developed. The amount of C2H4 was greater in the potential range where both metallic Cu and Cu2O existed. With electrode B, the main product was H-2, the SP value was negative, the TPPE activity was much smaller and Cu2O existed more preferentially than metallic Cu. With electrode C, the surface underwent oxidation easily when immersed in solution. With increasing plasma treatment time the hydrocarbon products decreased, the SP value was lower and the TPPE activity was smaller. It is suggested that the adsorbed oxygen present at the electrode surfaces can lead to an increase in the number of electrons available at the surfaces and also contribute to the adsorption Of CO2, resulting in hydrocarbon production.

A two-step mechanism was considered for the catalytic reaction, including the hydrogen splitting by the FLPs (step 1) and reduction reaction by the hydrogenated FLPs (FLPH(2)s) (step 2). The boron atom in the studied FLPs is bonded to various substituents, which have substantial effects on the performance of the B atom as a Lewis acid. The studied FLPs are classified into two distinguished categories. The quantum theory of atoms in molecules method and natural bond orbital analyses showed that more occupation of the p orbital of boron by the substituted groups causes the reluctance of the boron atom in hydrogen splitting and acceptation of electron density of the hydride ion. However, molecular electrostatic potential at the nuclear positions was used as a novel descriptor in justification of the kinetic behavior of FLPs in hydrogen splitting and reduction reactions. Obtained Delta Delta V(n)values in the donor-acceptor interacting system, as an outcome of the electrostatic potential concept, show a remarkable linear correlation with the calculated barrier energies ( increment G(not equal)) of hydrogen splitting and reduction reactions. This linear correlation can be observed for Delta Delta V(n)values vs electron localization function and localized orbital locator of the developing bond at transition states 1 and 2. Finally, it is concluded that similar activation energies for hydrogen splitting and reduction reactions can be an appropriate criterion for the performance and efficacy of the studied FLPs in the overall reaction.\nDoi:10.1002_qua.26416", "label": []}

We evaluated the effect of different treatments, electropolishing (Cu-p), and annealing treatments under oxidizing (Cu-Air) and reducing (Cu-H-2) conditions, on the performance of Cu electrodes designed for CO2RR. Characterizations revealed the presence of Cu2O and CuO layers on the surface of the Cu-Air electrode.

Overall, the HCOO- concentration increased with an increasing KHCO3 concentration, while the FE increased up to 46%, due to insertion of CO2 into the electrical double layer, generating an intermediate specie prior to the electrochemical CO2RR.

Tandem catalysis for CO2 reduction is an efficient strategy to overcome such problems.

To solve the poisoning species problem, the electrochemical reduction of CO2 was carried out using a copper electrode with a pulse electrolysis mode with anodic as well as cathodic polarization.

Increasing the potential of the electrode to more negative potentials, or increasing the proton concentration of the counter solution, caused a decrease in the faradaic efticiencies due to a relative increase in the rate of proton reduction vs. that of CO2 reduction.

However, there has not been much attention for CO2 reduction on copper in alkaline electrolytes, because this creates a carbonate buffer in which CO2 is converted in HCO3 (-) and the pH of the electrolyte decreases. Here, we show that electrolytes with phosphate buffers, which start off in the alkaline region and, after saturation with CO2, end up in the neutral region, behave differently compared to CO2 reduction in phosphate buffers which starts off in the neutral region. In initially alkaline buffers, a reduction peak is observed, which is not seen in neutral buffer solutions. In contrast with earlier literature reports, we show that this peak is not due to the formation of a CO adlayer on the electrode surface but due to the production of formate via direct bicarbonate reduction. The intensity of the reduction peak is influenced by electrode morphology and the identity of the cations and anions in solution. It is found that a copper nanoparticle-covered electrode gives a rise in intensity in comparison with mechanically polished and electropolished electrodes. The peak is observed in the SO4 (2-)-, ClO4 (-)-, and Cl-- containing electrolytes, but the formate-forming peak is not seen with Br- and I-.\nDoi:10.1007_s10008-013-2100-9", "label": []}

Cu2O nanospheres with a uniform size of similar to 180 nm were initially synthesized. Thereafter, Cu2O was used as a sacrificial template to prepare a series of Ag/Cu2O composites through galvanic replacement. By varying the Ag/Cu atomic ratio, Ag-0.125/Cu2O, having a hierarchical, flower-like nanostructure with intersecting Ag nanoflakes encompassing an inner Cu2O sphere, was prepared. The as-prepared Ag-x/Cu2O samples presented higher Faradaic efficiencies (FE) for CO and relatively suppressed H(2)evolution than the parent Cu2O nanospheres due to the combination of Ag with Cu2O in the former. Notably, the highest CO evolution rate was achieved with Ag-0.125/Cu2O due to the larger electroactive surface area furnished by the hierarchical structure. The same hierarchical flower-like structure was also obtained for the Au-0.6/Cu2O composite, where the FECO(10%) was even higher than that of Ag-0.125/Cu2O.

On varying the applied potentials and reducing environment at different volumetric ratio of CO2/CO and CO2/H-2, electrochemical measurements are carried out to understand the role of reducing atmosphere. On the Cu-PDC composite electrode, a significantly improved reduction current (-0.84Acm(-2) at V-app=2.5V) is measured as compared to the Cu-infiltrated electrode reported earlier. Oxygen vacancy formation energy on doped ceria surface is calculated, using density functional theory, and found to be relatively lower (E-vac=84.6kJmole(-1)) as compared to the un-doped ceria surface (E-vac=152.8kJmole(-1)), indicating facile oxygen anion transport in Cu-PDC. Density of state calculations shows Pr substitution in ceria responsible for the reduction in band gap [O(2p)Ce(4f)] from 1.75 to 0.4eV, contributing to electronic conduction. The theoretical results thus elucidate the activity of Pr-doped ceria materials for CO2 reduction to CO.

Here, we demonstrate that engineering the gas-liquid-solid contact interface on the electrode surface could tailor the selectivity of CO2 reduction and meanwhile suppress H-2 production through regulated reaction kinetics. Specifically, polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) was utilized to modify a Cu nanoarray electrode as an example, which is able to change the electrode surface from aerophobic to aerophilic state. The enriched nano-tunnels of the Cu nanoarray electrode can facilitate CO2 transportation and pin gaseous products on the electrode surface. The latter is believed to be the reason that boosts the Faradaic efficiency of liquid products by 67% and limits the H-2 production to less than half of before. This interface engineering strategy also lowered H2O (proton) affinity, therefore promoting CO and HCOOH production.

However, during the electrochemical reaction, Cu catalysts inevitably undergo surface reconstruction whose impact on CO2 conversion performance remains contentious. Here we report that polycrystalline Cu nanoparticles (denoted as Cu-s) with rich high-index facets, derived from Cu2-xS through desulphurization and surface reconstruction, offer an excellent platform for investigating the role of surface reconstruction in electrocatalytic CO2 conversion. During the formation of Cu-s catalyst, the two stages of desulphurization and surface reconstruction can be clearly resolved by in situ X-ray absorption spectroscopy and OH- adsorption characterizations, which are well correlated with the changes in electrocatalytic performance. It turns out that the high CO2 conversion performance, achieved by the Cu-s catalyst (Faradic efficiency of 68.6% and partial current density of 40.8 mA/cm(2) in H-cell toward C2H4 production), is attributed to the increased percentage of high-index facets in Cu-s during the surface reconstruction. Furthermore, the operando electrochemical Raman spectroscopy further reveals that the conversion of the CO2 into the C2H4 on Cu-s is intermediated by the production of *COCHO.

According to Fick First Law, the interior Cu atoms of the AuCu3 alloy with Au-rich surface gradually segregated outwards during heating, realizing Cu-rich surface eventually. Correspondingly, the competing electrocatalytic CO2 reduction (ECR) to CO and hydrogen evolution reactions (HER) were tactfully balanced on these alloy surfaces, thus achieving proportion-tunable syngas (CO/H-2). Density functional theory (DFT) calculations on the Gibbs free energy change of the COOH* and H* (Delta G(COOH*), Delta G(H*)) on the alloy surfaces were conducted, which are generally considered as the selectivity descriptors for CO and H-2 products, respectively. It shows Delta G(COOH*) gradually increases in contrast to the decreased Delta G(H*) with more Cu on the surface, suggesting H-2 is more favored over Cu sites, which is consistent with the declining CO/H-2 ratio observed in the experiments.

In contrast, the 1-ML-thick Ni/Cu(111) system exhibited increased selectivity for CH4 production compared with that of clean Ni(111), which may stem from the geometric tensile strain induced by the underlying Cu(111) substrate. Notably, bimetallic surfaces consisting of 0.1-ML-thick Ni or Pt grown on Cu(111) exhibited significantly different reduction behaviors compared with those of Cu because of the presence of the a small amount of epitaxially grown metal.

We found that, in electrolytic CO2 reduction using an electrolytically plated Cu-Co electrode, a hydrocarbon product with high faradaic efficiency (FE) could be obtained with low-FE CO. The plated electrodes have a Co solid solution on the Cu surface. The non-localized Co changes the adsorption energy of the reaction intermediate in CO2 reduction. Consequently, by increasing the Co content in Cu, HCOOH can be selectively produced. Further, in electrolytic CO2 reduction with an applied potential of -1.19V vs. reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE), the selectivity of methane (CH4) production improved, while the selectivity of ethylene (C2H4) formation lowered. In the reduction using the plated electrode containing 14% Co, the FE of CH4 production reached the highest at 47.7%. These results suggested that mixing Co in Cu promotes the hydrogenation of CH2* to CH3* and inhibits the dimerization of CH2* species. Furthermore, this research on plated electrodes is useful for the development of catalytic electrodes for electrolytic CO2 reduction.\nDoi:10.1007_s12678-018-0492-0", "label": [[23, 30, "CH4"], [107, 112, "Cu-M"], [1084, 1089, "Faradaic efficiency"], [1120, 1225, "alloy"]]}

This article reports significant features of in situ infrared spectra of adsorbed CO in detail, obtained with a Cu polycrystal electrode in aqueous electrolytes at 0 to 2 degrees C with regard to electrochemical reduction of CO2 to hydrocarbons. Two infrared absorption peaks were assigned to adsorbed CO. A sharp absorption band appeared at ca. 2080 cm(-1) between -0.8 and -1.0 V vs. nhe in 0.2 M KHCO3. Another absorption peak was broad at 2040 cm(-1) between -0.7 and -0.8 V in the same solution. The infrared absorption intensity is closely related with the amount of charge accompanied with CO adsorption. The infrared absorption bands were studied using D2O electrolyte solutions; the results agreed well with those obtained in H2O electrolyte system. Thus the spectra will not be affected by hydrogen. Infrared absorption bands of reduced CO2 were measured as well, showing identical spectroscopic features with adsorbed CO. The reduced CO2 is present at -1.0 V at Cu electrode and not present at -0.4 V. The reduced CO2 at Cu electrode is thus identified as adsorbed CO.\nDoi:10.1016_0013-4686(95)00239-B", "label": []}

Significant performance differences were found between rough and smooth surface electrodes and between thermally and non-thermally treated electrodes. A rough surface was much more active than a smooth one in terms of CE and catalytic electrode life. The total CE for hydrocarbon production (CH4, C2H4) increased with electrolysis time during the first electrolysis stage and decreased afterwards. For the formation of CH4 a two-path reaction scheme was proposed. The electrode deactivation was attributed to the formation of a poisonous intermediate, which is the same both for the CH2O and CO2 reduction.

The reduction of CO2 at Cu + Au electrodes leads to a decrease in the mean current efficiency (CE) for methane, formic acid and alcohols and to an increase in CE for CO and H2, as coverage of the copper surface by gold is increased. The CE for ethylene formation displays a small maximum for low coverage of the copper surface with gold, and consequently a decrease with increasing surface coverage.

Reduction products were CO, CH4, C2H4 and methyl formate (HCOOCH3). Methyl formate was formed by the reaction between solvent, methanol, and a CO2 reduction product, formic acid, which corresponds to formic acid formation in aqueous systems. Basically, most electrodes gave the same principal product both in the present system and in the aqueous system. At W, Ti and Pt electrodes, CO2 reduction was inefficient. Sn and Pb electrodes were active in formate production. However, CO was formed much more efficiently in the present system than in the aqueous system. It was indicated that Sn and Pb served as electrodes catalyzing formate production, while the supporting electrolyte, tetrabutylammonium cation, promoted CO formation. Electrolysis at Ag, Zn and Pd electrodes yielded CO mainly. Hydrocarbon formation at a Cu electrode was less efficient than in aqueous systems. However, hydrocarbon was formed efficiently at an Ni electrode. These differences in hydrocarbon formation in the present system, in comparison with aqueous systems, could be explained by the balance between hydrogen atom and CO2 reduction intermediates on the electrode surface.\nDoi:10.1016_0022-0728(95)04374-8", "label": []}

To address this issue, we adopt different structures of solid liquid interface to mimic the reaction circumstance using density functional theory calculations. We find that the reaction barriers and energies are sensitive to the reaction circumstance, such as the state of water molecules, the number of water molecules, and the available surface sites, whereas the selectivity of CO2 reduction can be hardly changed once a water bilayer network on Cu surface is used. In particular, a solid liquid interface built from 4-6-4 water rings (5H(2)O/1H) can present an appropriate description of the solvent, predicting the formation pathways of HCOOH in reasonable agreement with the experiments.

Remarkably, the nature of the cathodic-catalyst carbon support had a strong influence on the electrocatalytic activity and selectivity of the system.

The highly conductive N-doped porous carbon cloth as substrate enables a largely uniform distribution of N-doped defects, which can provide more active sites for the nucleation and growth of anchoring nano-sized Cn/Sn (3.39 nm). The as-prepared electrode (Cu(1)Sn(4)-N-CC), with a 3D-hierarchical porous honeycomb structure, could not only favor the diffusion of electrolyte and serve as \"transfer posts\" to confine the intermediates of reduced CO2, but also provide abundant terrace, ledge and kink atoms to function as active site for highly efficient CO2RR. As such, the obtained Cu(1)Sn(4)-N-CC electrode convert CO2 to formate with allured faradic efficiency (90.24 %), partial current density (15.56 mA cm(-2)) and production rate (173 mu mol h(-1) cm(-2)) at -0.97 V-RHE, along with a long-term tolerance in CO2RR.

The effect is generally attributed to the cathodic deposition of Fe and Zn impurities from the electrolyte. Herein, an experimental-theoretical study shows the existence of potentialand facet-dependent pathways for CO2 reduction to CH4 on Cu. The small-overpotential pathway deactivates the electrodes, while the large-overpotential pathway does not. Theoretical modeling traces the origin of the deactivation to *COH and *CHO, the two *CO hydrogenation products. *COH, which reduces to *C (precursor to coke), is more stable than *CHO around the equilibrium potential, but its symmetry factor is smaller. Hence, the *COH-based coking pathway opens first until the potential is negative enough for the *CHO-based pathway to dominate. This highlights the often-neglected role of symmetry factors in electrocatalysis design and suggests that small increases in *CHO's symmetry factor can mitigate Cu deactivation.\nDoi:10.1016_j.apcatb.2020.119776", "label": [[110, 112, "Cu"], [103, 106, "CH4"], [447, 496, "structure control"]]}

Though these catalysts possess relatively high selectivity towards CO, their current densities are usually low, which hardly satisfy industrial requirements. Achieving industrial current densities requires robust catalyst supports alongside efficient electron/substrate interaction at catalytically active sites. Herein, we select anthracite coal with a naturally robust architecture as the catalyst support, whose internal dense framework favours electron transport. The controllable activation method is used to form numerous micropores at the surface of coal particles without destroying the internal structures. The spatial confinement growth effect of micropores within the coal matrix contributes to the fixation of nickel-nitrogen (Ni-N) active sites within the micropores to prevent excessive agglomeration of metallic atoms, therefore enhancing the catalyst utilization. Furthermore, confinement space provided by plentiful micropores favours the adsorption of CO2, ensuring the instantaneous supply of a sufficient concentration of the substrate molecules to adjacent active sites firmly anchored in the micropores. Accordingly, the robust coal matrix can not only promote electrons from the inside to surface catalytic centres but also capture CO2 from the outside to active sites, thus intensifying the electron/substrate interaction of Ni-N active sites. In a flow cell, the coal-matrix electrocatalyst co-doped with nickel and nitrogen exhibits an industrylevel current density of 223 mA cm-2, a high faradaic efficiency of 97% for CO production and a long-term stability of continuously working for as long as 120 h.

The energy efficiency for reduction of CO2 to formate can reach to 50% when an IrxSnyRuzO2/Ti electrode is used as anode, it is one of the highest values found in the literatures and very practicable for sustainable fuel synthesis.

To date, only Cu electrodes, of all metals examined experimentally, have been shown to be capable of producing significant quantities of hydrocarbons with adequate Faradaic efficiency from CO2 electroreduction. In this work, we use density functional theory calculations to study size dependent changes on the adsorption of reaction intermediates and reaction free energy for CO2 reduction on Cu nanoparticles ranging from 13 to 561 atoms. We found that the adsorbate-induced surface charge perturbation on Cu nanoparticles becomes more local as the Cu nanoparticles size increases, and the extent of charge perturbations on 309 atom Cu appears to be very similar in Cu(1 1 1) surface. For two-electron products (CO, HCOOH and H-2), Cu-147 appears near the top in the volcano plots, implying that Cu-147 has a near optimal binding energy of the key intermediates to produce two-electron products. To identify the active sites for the CO 2 reduction, we compared the activity of different reaction sites, namely, facet, edge and corner sites of Cu nanoparticles, Cu(1 1 1), Cu(1 0 0), Cu(2 1 1) and hexagonal Cu nanowire. We find that the under-coordinated sites are more active than the low-index surfaces.

Among the C1 products, formic acid (HCOOH) is chemically stable in the liquid phase at room temperature and is the simplest energy source that can be synthesized from CO2. The electrochemical CO2RR on Cu has been widely studied due to its very high selectivity toward target products and mild reaction conditions. However, electrochemistry activity can be impacted by many catalytic surface properties, including the morphology, crystallinity and surface index. Cu has a face-centered cubic (FCC) structure, and the Cu(1 1 1) surface index tends to be naturally exposed. Since the number of dangling bonds on the surface of the catalyst is different for each exposed surface, each surface activity is different, and the reaction pathway may also be different. The surface indexes of Cu (1 0 0) and (2 1 1) can be observed as a supported catalyst, and Cu(1 1 0) can be observed in a rod shape nanoparticle. Herein, we performed CO2RR over each surface and proposed an energy diagram of HCOOH formation via the COOH and HCOO intermediates using spin-polarized density functional theory. We elucidate the determining factor of catalytic activity and discuss the relationship between the coordination number/surface roughness (caused by the different surface facet) and the activity through electronic analysis of the d orbitals.\nDoi:10.1016_j.apsusc.2020.146857", "label": []}

Here by means of firstprinciple computations, the geometric constructions, electronic structures, and CO2RR catalytic performance of boron- and nitrogen-doped graphdiyne anchoring a single Cu atom (Cu@N-doped GDY and Cu@B-doped GDY) were systematically investigated. These eight Cu@doped GDY complexes possess excellent stability. The adsorption free energies showed that the eight Cu@doped GDY could spontaneously capture CO2 molecules. The Cu@N-doped GDY monolayers exhibit a more efficient catalytic performance for CO2 reduction compared to Cu@B-doped GDY because of the differences in adsorption energies and charge transfer. The calculations further indicated that the Cu@Nb-doped GDY complex possesses excellent catalytic character toward CO2RR with the same limiting potentials of -0.65 V for production of HCOOH, CO, OCH2, CH3OH, and CH4.

Tremendous efforts have been made to copper based electrocatalysts, which are well-known for producing C2+ products. However, being short of well-defined catalysts with stable Cu delta+ electronic structure hinders its practical application and in-depth understanding. Herein, we developed a facile one-pot approach to prepare Cu delta+ -rich catalyst by doping phosphorus.

Moreover, the morphology of sharpened catalysts was relatively random and nonuniform, making it difficult to quantify the curvature of nanostructures.

In the present study, density functional theory (DFT) is applied to study the reduction mechanism of CO2 to formic acid (HCOOH) and methanol (CH3OH) on the Cu(1 1 1), Sn@Cu(1 1 1) and Sn(2 1 1) catalysts. The adsorption structures of all possible intermediates are determined. It is found that for the HCOOH pathway, the rate-limiting step form the reduction of CO2 to form HCOO on the Cu(1 1 1) and Sn@Cu(1 1 1) surface is transformed to the reduction of HCOO forming HCOOH on the Sn(2 1 1) surface. The activity of three catalyst models towards HCOOH production follows: Sn@Cu(1 1 1) > Sn(2 1 1) > Cu(1 1 1). For the CH3OH pathway, the potential rate-limiting step on the Cu(1 1 1), Sn@Cu(1 1 1) and Sn(2 1 1) surfaces is the formation of COOH via CO2.

A mixed anaerobic consortium from biological origin typically produces methane from CO2 reduction which circumvents production of multi-carbon compounds. This study aimed to develop a stable and robust CO2 reducing biocathode from a mixed culture inoculum avoiding the methane generation. An effective approach was demonstrated based on (i) an enrichment procedure involving inoculum pre-treatment and several culture transfers in H-2:CO2 media, (ii) a transfer from heterotrophic to autotrophic growth and (iii) a sequentialbatch operation. Biomass growth and gradual acclimation to CO2 electro-reduction accomplished a maximum acetate production rate of 400 mg Urlatibolyte (L-catholyte(-1) d(-1) at -1V (vs. Ag/AgCl).

Herein, we reported a facile and scalable strategy to prepare the Cu single-atom catalyst (Cu SAs/NC) with exceptional CO production performances. Atomically dispersed Cu-N-4 moieties are unambiguously verified by HAADF-STEM and XANES measurements. The as-prepared Cu SAs/NC catalyst delivers a high CO faradaic efficiency of 92% at -0.7 V-RHE as well as the excellent durability over 30 h successive electrolysis. It should be noted that this is one of the rare examples of efficient CO production on Cu single-atom electrocatalyst. Besides, the 20-g + samples can be readily fabricated in one batch and exhibit the almost identical CO2RR performances. Furthermore, the combined experimental and theoretical calculation results identify the genuine active Cu-N-4 sites are responsible for the high selectivity and efficiency of CO production. This work provides a novel strategy for scalable single-atom electrocatalysts in stable quality and offers new insights into the efficient CO2-to-CO conversion on Cu single-atom electrocatalyst.

The Cu-terminated surface is found to be more favored than the O-terminated surface at potentials less than 0.52 V-SHE at a pH = 7. Adsorption stabilities of H*, OH*, 0*, and H2O* were examined by calculating the formation free energy of the adsorbate as a function of electrode potential. A H* covered surface is the most favored surface under reduction conditions. At pH values of 7 and 13, formation of an O-vacancy requires potentials of 0.61 and 0.25 V-SHE, respectively. At more negative potentials relevant to reduction of CO2, formation of an O-vacancy is thermodynamically favored, indicating a facile reduction of the Cu2O surface as observed experimentally.

The Rh/YSZ/Pt cells lead to CO and CH4 formation and the open-circuit selectivity to CH4 is less than 5%. Both positive and negative applied potentials enhance significantly the total hydrogenation rate but the selectivity to CH4 remains below 12%. The Cu/TiO2/YSZ/Au cells produce CO, CH4 and C2H4 with selectivities to CH4 and C2H4 up to 80% and 2%. Both positive and negative applied potential significantly enhance the hydrogenation rate and the selectivity to C2H4. It was found that the addition of small (similar to 0.5 kPa) amounts of CH3OH in the feed has a pronounced promotional effect on the reaction rate and selectivity of the Cu/TiO2/YSZ/Au cells. The selective reduction of CO2 to CH4 starts at 220 degrees C (vs 320 degrees C in absence of CH3OH) with near 100% CH4 selectivity at open-circuit and under polarization conditions at temperatures 220-380 degrees C.

Without copper oxide particles, only formic acid and carbon monoxide were formed in the electrochemical reduction of CO2, and the formation of hydrocarbons could scarcely be observed.

The maximum formation efficiencies of methane and ethylene were of 7.5% and 6.8% with the electrode consisted of Cu2O/Zn, respectively.

The Cu catalyst film was deposited by electroless and characterised both as prepared and after testing. The presence of Cu' and relatively big Cu particles probably determined the high selectivity to CH3OH and the unusual small selectivity to CO and CH4. Selectivities to CH3OH, C2H5OH and C2H6O were electrochemically enhanced up to a maximum of 34, 22 and 3.4 times, respectively. The optimum temperature for the electrochemically assisted CO2 hydrogenation was selected to be 325 C. Higher gas flow rates favoured the synthesis of dimethyl ether at the expense of methanol and ethanol formation. CO2 conversion increased with H-2/CO2 ratio, whereas selectivity to fuels showed a maximum for a H-2/CO2 ratio of 2.

Great efforts have been devoted to developing versatile technologies/processes to adjust and manipulate the rapid growth of CO2 emission. Besides CO2 capture and storage/sequestration (CCS) to control its emission, chemical utilization of the captured CO2 (CCU) emerges to be a rational technique for economical benefits as well as environmental concerns. As for the aim of CO2 utilization, an environmentally benign CO2/water reversible acidic system was developed for the copper (II)-catalyzed selective oxybromination of electron-rich aromatics without the need of any conventional acid additive and organic solvent. Notably, up to 95% yields of the bromination products were attained with good regio-selectivity when cupric bromide was used as the catalyst and lithium bromide as a cheap and easy handling bromine source under supercritical CO2. The catalytic system worked well for electron-rich aromatics including ethers, sulfides and mesitylene. Carbonic acid in situ formed from CO2 and water is supposed to act as the proton donator in the Bronsted acid-promoted reaction. Notably, CO2 in this study serves as a reaction medium and a promoter in conjunction with water and also provides safe environment for aerobic reactions. Given with excellent reaction efficiency as well as no need of neutralization disposal, this process thus represents an environmentally friendly approach for aerobic bromination of aromatics with essential reduction of CO2 emission as well as an economically beneficial way for application of captured CO2.

Comparing the absolute formation rate and Faradaic selectivity of H-2, CH4, CO, and C2H4 as a function of the applied electrode potential, we show that variations in the bulk buffer capacities of the electrolyte have substantial impact on absolute product formation rates and relative faradic selectivity. We find that high concentrations of bicarbonate improve the overall Faradaic CO2 electroreduction activity, largely due to higher absolute formation rates of H-2 and CH4. In lower-concentrated bicarbonate electrolytes with their lower overall activity, the selectivity toward ethylene was drastically enhanced. Following earlier theoretical work, we hypothesize the pH near the copper electrode interface to largely account for the observed effects: diluted KHCO3 solutions allow for more alkaline local pH values during CO2 electroreduction. Our study highlights the controlling role of the interfacial pH on the product distribution during CO2 reduction over a wide electrode potential range. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

Although ethanol and ethylene share common intermediates at the early stages of CO/CO2 reduction to C-2 species on copper, the pathways bifurcate and most copper surfaces favor the formation of ethylene. We present here a combined experimental-computational study of the electroreduction of acetaldehyde to ethanol on Cu(1 11), Cu(1 0 0) and Cu(3 2 2). The experiments show structure-sensitive onset potentials for acetaldehyde reduction such that lower overpotentials are observed for more open facets (eta(322)< eta 1(00) < eta(111)). Our DFT calculations show that the electrochemical reduction of acetaldehyde proceeds via a CH3CH2O* intermediate on the three electrodes at high *H coverage, and that the stability of this weakly bound intermediate determines the onset potential. Our results suggest that during the late stages of CO/CO2 reduction to C-2 species on copper, ethanol formation has higher energetic barriers than ethylene formation, and hence the selectivity is inclined toward the latter. Importantly, our results suggest that the barriers for ethanol formation can be lowered by making use of its structure sensitivity. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

In particular, two pH parameters appear to be important in controlling product selectivity of the CO2 reduction process. We study how both bulk and local pH conditions affect product distributions during CO2 reduction on oxygen-evacuated Cu2O electrode. In contrast with previous studies of local pH effect on CO2 reduction using metallic Cu, our results suggest that not always is the preferential production of C2 compounds (C2H4+C2H6) achieved by high local pH condition irrespective of catalyst materials, but rather bulk pH condition could contribute to ability to control product selectivity. It is finally demonstrated that the bulk pH effect, often underestimated but related to carbonate speciation, is associated with the direct reduction of HCO3- to HCOO-. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

We show that the temperature of an electrolyte solution can influence several reaction parameters in the CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR), including pH (both local and bulk), concentration of dissolved CO2 ([CO2]), solution resistance, the rate of diffusion of reactants to the electrode surface, and adsorbed intermediates. The working potential was -1.60V vs. Ag/AgCI to allow direct comparison with literature values. Under optimal reaction conditions at 2 degrees C, the faradaic efficiency (FE) for converting CO2 to methane (CH4) on a Cu electrocatalyst increases to ca. 50% while ethylene (C2H4) decreases to ca. 10%. Above room temperature, the production of hydrogen gas (H-2) dominates the electrochemical reaction, reaching >50% FE. The major products (i.e., >5% FE) observed at all temperatures studied were H-2, CH4, C2H4, carbon monoxide, and formate, with product selectivity driven by changes in [CO2] rather than changes in pH. Our initial goal was to confirm pH dependence of CO2RR on Cu at different temperatures. Importantly, we discovered that pH varies minimally over the temperature range studied (2 degrees C to 42 degrees C), in contrast to changes in [CO2] and corresponding changes in product selectivity.

Selective formation of C-2 over the C-1 products, however, is a formidable challenge on all electrocatalysts known in literature. Here, we report the selectivity of CuO-derived porous copper nanoribbon arrays as the electrode to convert CO2 to C-2 products. The C-C bond coupling occurred at electrode potentials <-0.701 V vs. RHE. The total Faradaic efficiency towards the formation of these C-2 compounds (C2H4, C2H6 and C2H5OH) reached to similar to 40% at -0.816 V vs. RHE under ambient pressure and temperature. More importantly, at the same condition, the total Faradaic efficiency for C-1 products (CO and HCOO-) was <3%, which were major products when a Cu2O-derived Cu electrode was used. Methane was not observed, a key product on a Cu foil electrode. This increased selectivity towards the formation of C-2 chemicals, meanwhile suppressed C-1 chemicals, are attributed to the presence of surface defects and a large number of grain boundaries on the CuO-derived porous Cu nanoribbon arrays electrode. Moreover, the activation of CO2 was found to likely occur at the copper surface; while the presence of copper oxide layer reported in literature may result from the interaction between copper and water during the post analysis process.

Cu/SWNT, Cu/RGO and Cu/OLC composite catalysts are synthesized and characterized by X-ray diffraction analysis, transmission electron microscopy and electrochemical surface area measurements. Electrocatalytic activities of the synthesized materials, as measured in an electrochemical cell connected to a gas chromatograph, are compared to that of Cu NPs supported on Vulcan carbon. All four catalysts demonstrate higher activity towards C2H4 generation vs CH4, with production of the latter mostly suppressed on Cu NPs supported on nanostructured substrates. Onset potentials for C2H4 vs CH4 generation demonstrate 200 mV positive shifts for Cu/SWNT, Cu/RGO, and Cu/OLC catalysts. The Cu/OLC catalyst is found to be superior to the other two nanostructured catalysts in terms of stability, activity and selectivity towards C2H4 generation. Its faradaic efficiency reached 60% at -1.8 V vs Ag/AgCl. The enhanced stability and activity of the Cu/OLC catalyst can be attributed to the unique catalyst design, wherein a shell of OLC surrounds the Cu NPs. Such a configuration enables the outer layer to act as a filter that protects the Cu surface from adsorption of undesirable species, enhances its electrocatalytic performance, and improves its viability in CO2 electroreduction reaction. The enhanced selectivity of the Cu/OLC catalyst towards the C2H4 production is most likely related to the enhanced electrocatalytic activity of the OLC support towards the CO2 electroreduction to CO. Higher CO surface concentration from CO2 electroreduction on the OLC support, rather than a greater number of available sites for CO dimerization, likely originated this behavior. CO molecules generate on surfaces of OLCs, dimerize on Cu NP (100) planes, and, subsequently, yield additional C2H4 molecules. Both the reduction of the CO2 to CO on the surface of OLCs and reduction of \"extra\" CO molecules to C2H4 on the surface of Cu NPs are expected to lead to an increase in the local pH, which is also beneficial for the C2H4 production.

Comparing the Faradaic selectivity of formate as a function of the applied electrode potential and electrolysis time, it is found that CuO incorporation can significantly improve the activity of SnO2-CuO composite catalysts.

ZnO supported on CNT is a low-cost electro catalyst that can produce syngas from CO2 and H2O. A rational catalyst design strategy for further improvement of the ZnO/CNT catalyst is to dope with copper to strengthen the binding energy of the CO intermediate, which could improve the activity. In this work, a series of CuZnO/CNT catalysts with intimate Cu and Zn contact and various Cu loadings are prepared. By varying the copper content we show that the synergy of copper and zinc improves the activity for CO formation, and the optimal copper content is 20 at%. On hydrogen evolution, the addition of copper has a two-fold effect. This reaction is enhanced by the reduced ZnO particle size obtained when copper is added, but at similar particle sizes of ZnO, a suppression is observed with increasing copper content as CO evolution is enhanced.

In present study, an approach to promote ethanol production is employed through adding Au, which is favorable toward CO formation, onto Cu2O catalysts. Namely, the Cu2O hollow nanospheres with a size of 150-180 nm were synthesized by a soft template method, and then Au nanoparticles of similar to 7 nm were loaded to obtain Aux/Cu2O composites. The Aux/Cu2O catalysts have an earlier onset for ethanol production than Cu2O. Besides, Aux/Cu2O catalysts display the significantly enhanced Faraday efficiencies (FEs) of CO and ethanol, the suppressed hydrogen evolution reaction and the slightly weakened HCOOH formation. Among them, Au-0.17/Cu2O stands out with the highest FEs of ethanol from 10.8%-16.2% throughout the measuring potentials, suggesting an optimal amount of Au. Furthermore, it is found that the FEs of ethanol increase as the atomic ratio of Au/Cu increases at the medium reduction potentials (-1.1 V to -1.3 V). Besides, it is demonstrated that ethanol formation is more favorable over ethylene formation, evidenced by the ratio of FEethanol/FEethylene reaching 2.0, 3.3, 4.1 on three Au-x/Cu2O catalysts, respectively. This correlation between the ethanol production and the Au amount reflects that Au plays a crucial role in promoting ethanol formation.

However, the energy required for CO2 activation and the subsequent required multiple number of proton-coupled electron transfer steps, makes this process very challenging. Besides, catalytic material limitations hamper the application of this technology in the short term. Consequently, in this work we synthesise, characterise and preliminarily evaluate bimetallic Cu-based hollow fibre electrodes with a compact three-dimensional geometry to overcome mass transfer limitations and to enhance the electrochemical conversion of CO2. The Cu hollow fibres are functionalised with Au in an attempt to tune the binding energy of the CO* intermediate, which appears to be key in the reduction of CO2. The Cu fibres are also functionalised with Ni, aiming to decrease the reaction overpotential, resulting in beneficial energy efficiency. The so prepared Cu-based porous hollow fibre electrodes are obtained by dry-wet spinning and electrodeposition procedures. The materials are then characterised by scanning electron microscopy, energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy, X-ray diffraction analyses and cyclic voltammetry.

For the CO2 conversion, Ti/TiO2/CuO n-p junction semiconductor was chosen owing to its heterojunction benefits. The material was constructed using dip-coating technique and was found to present high porosity for both TiO2 and CuO deposits. Photocurrent vs potential curves showed a relatively good electrode photoactivity for CO2 dissolved in NaHCO3 subjected to UV-Vis commercial irradiation. The CO2 reduction process is found to be deeply affected by the type of electrolyte that, in essence, acts by supporting and generating different quantities of methanol, ethanol and acetone.

In the cathode, CO2 reacts with supplied electrons to form CO fuel and O-2-ions (CO2+2e(-) -> CO+O2-). Too low affinity of Cu cathode to CO2 in cell B reduced the reactivity of the CO2 with electrons. The CO fuel, O2- ions and CH4 gas were transported to the anode through the porous GDC mixed conductor of O-2-ions and electrons. In the anode, CH4 reacts with O2- ions to produce CO and H-2 fuels (CH4+O2- -> 2 H-2+CO+2e(-)). The reforming efficiency at 700-800 degrees C was lowest in cell B and highest in cell A. The Cu anode in cells A and C worked well to oxidize CH4 with O2- ions (2Cu+O2- -> Cu2O+2e-, Cu2O+CH4 -> 2Cu+CO+2H(2)). However, a blockage of the outlet gas occurred in all the cells at 700-800 degrees C.

The surface morphology and structural interaction between Cu2O and MWCNTs at different Cu2O loadings (10-50 wt%) were characterized by SEM, TEM, EDX, XRD, BET, TGA, and Raman spectroscopy.

As the results indicate, owing to the synergistic effect of adjacent CuxO and Ni sites, a Cu/CuxO/Ni electrode has a very good and stable electrocatalytic activity to reduce CO2. As tested in this study, the product of the electrocatalytic reduction of CO2 (i.e. activated CO2, or CO2 center dot-) can be used for the electrocarboxylation of pyridine in mild conditions. Once an electron is transferred from CO2 center dot- to pyridine, a pyridine radical anion is formed. Based on the EC'C'CC mechanism, this radical anion reacts with CO(2)(center dot- )and produces isonicotinic acid as the main product. In addition, two pyridine radical anions react together and produce a 4,4'-bipyridine dimer. The high stability of the electrocatalyst during the electrolysis process and the simplicity of the workup make the proposed modified electrode appropriate for the electrosynthesis of some organic compounds.

The results show that CO is a common intermediate on Cu(1 1 1) and Cu(1 0 0) surfaces, and its further reduction is the crucial selectivity-determining step.

However, the challenge of meeting its targets lies mainly in the intimate relationship between GHG emissions and energy production, which in turn links to industry and economic growth. The Middle East and North African region (MENA), particularly those nations rich oil and gas (O&G) resources, depend on these as a main income source. Persuading the region to cut down on O&G production or reduce its GHG emissions is hugely challenging, as it is so vital to its economic strength. In this paper, an alternative option is established by creating an economic link between GHG emissions, measured as their CO2 equivalent (CO2 e), and the earning of profits through the concept of Social Carbon Cost (SCC). The case study is a small coastal city in Libya where 6% of electricity is assumed to be generated from renewable sources. At times when renewable energy (RE) output exceeds the demand for power, the surplus is used for powering the production of hydrogen by electrolysis, thus storing the energy and creating an emission-free fuel. Two scenarios are tested based on short and long term SCCs. In the short term scenario, the amount of fossil fuel energy saved matches the renewable energy produced, which equates to the same amount of curtailed O&G production. The O&G-producing region can earn profits in two ways: (1) by cutting down CO2 emissions as a result of a reduction in O&G production and (2) by replacing an amount of fossil fuel with electrolytically-produced hydrogen which creates no CO2 emissions. In the short term scenario, the value of SCC saved is nearly 39% and in the long term scenario, this rose to 83%. (C) 2019 Published by Elsevier Ltd.\nDoi:10.1016_j.egyr.2019.05.003", "label": []}

However, it usually suffers from poor catalytic stability. In this work we propose a strategy of introducing crystal defects to change the reaction pathway and avoid accumulation of carbon on the Cu electrode surface, thus preventing its deactivation. Our experimental results show that carbon accumulation vanished and catalytic stability improved after crystal defects had been introduced into nano Cu electrodes. The correlation between the two rules: (1) crystal defects facilitate C2H4 formation while suppress CH4 generation; (2) crystal defects improve catalytic stability, reveals that the C2H4 formation pathway bypasses the carbon deposition associated with CH4 formation and results in stable catalytic performance. In particular, the Cu catalyst prepared according to this principle performed with good stability for 6 h almost without any change in Faradaic efficiency.

Tubular gas diffusion electrodes offer such properties. In this work, we present a methodology to fabricate tubular hollow fibre copper electrodes with drastically increased intrinsic porosity.

This opens up the opportunity for industrial application of Cu-based electrocatalysts. However, the stability of copper must first be assessed.

In this study, we show that by introducing a periodic pulsed operational mode during controlled potential electrolysis using low pulse frequencies in the range of Hz, the stability of ethylene production can be greatly increased from less than 8 h to at least 16 h. Furthermore, the method enables the reactivation of catalysts already deactivated for ethylene production.

Many workers reported that formation of CH4 and C2H(4) rapidly diminishes during electrolysis Of CO2 reduction. This paper shows that such deactivation of Cu electrode is reproduced with electrolyte solutions prepared from reagents used by these workers. Deactivated Cu electrodes recovered the electrocatalytic activity for CO2 reduction by anodic polarization at -0.05 V versus she in agreement with the previous reports. Features of the deactivation depend greatly on the individual chemical reagents. Purification of the electrolyte solution by preelectrolysis with a Pt black electrode effectively prevents the deactivation of Cu electrode. Anode stripping voltammetry of Cu electrodes, which were deactivated during electrolysis of CO2 reduction, showed anodic oxidation peaks at ca. -0.1 or -0.56 V versus she. The severer the deactivation of the Cu electrode was, the higher electric charge of the anodic peak was observed. It is presumed that some impurity heavy metal, originally contained in the electrolyte, is deposited on the Cu electrode during the CO2 reduction, poisoning the electrocatalytic activity. On the basis of the potential of the anodic peaks, Fe2+ and Zn2+ are assumed to be the major contaminants, which cause the deactivation of the Cu electrode. Deliberate addition of Fe2+ or Zn2+ to the electrolyte solutions purified by preelectrolysis exactly reproduced the deactivation of a Cu electrode in CO2 reduction. The amount of the deposited Fe or Zn on the electrode was below the monolayer coverage. Electrothermal atomic absorption spectrometry (etaas) showed that Fe originally contained in the electrolyte solution is effectively removed by the preelectrolysis of the solution. Mechanistic difference is discussed between Fe and Zn in the deterioration of the electrocatalytic property of Cu electrode in the CO2 reduction. The concentration of the impurity substances originally contained in the chemical reagents as Fe or Zn is estimated to be far below the standard of the impurity levels guaranteed by the manufacturers. Presence of trimethylamine in the electrolyte solution also severely poisons a Cu electrode in the CO2 reduction. It was concluded that the deactivation of Cu electrode in CO2 reduction is not caused by adsorption of the products or the intermediates produced in CO2 reduction. (C) 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

The prepared CuGC electrodes were used for the electrochemical NADH regeneration and electroenzymatic CO2 reduction at -1.0 V using formate dehydrogenase from Candida boidinii. The selective activation of NADH (1,4-NADH) approached 67% as the deposition cycle number increased. The electron mediator [Cp*Rh(bpy)Cl]Cl complex (Rh(III)) was used to obtain nearly 100% active NADH on the CuGC electrode. The electron transfer rate to Rh(III) is crucial for optimal NADH regeneration: Rh(III) should be reduced to RhH quickly as it has the capability to decompose NADH catalytically. This allows sufficiently high NAD(+) conversion and NADH regeneration reaction rates for the electroenzymatic CO2 reduction to formate. The optimum concentrations of Rh(III) and NAD(+) were estimated to be 0.25 and 1.00 mM, respectively. For the CuGC electrode prepared with 300 deposition cycles, the formate formation rate was estimated to be (6.28 +/- 0.02) x 10(-3) mu mol/mg(CbsFDH)/min, a three-fold increase compared to previously reported results on Cu foil electrode.

With an appropriate process procedure consisting of a sequence of electrolysis and purge steps, a Cu2O layer was formed during the purge steps.

{"id": 4393, "data": "Title:Effects of mass transfer on the electrocatalytic CO2 reduction on Cu\nAbstract:The effects of mass transfer on the electrocatalytic reduction of CO2 on a polycrystalline Cu rotating cylinder electrode were investigated. When the rotation rate was increased, the current efficiency toward CO2 reduction products decreased while that for the hydrogen evolution reaction increased. Furthermore, the product selectivity switched from CH4 to CO as the rotation rate was increased. This observation is generally inconsistent with the widely reported dependence of the electrocatalytic CO2 reduction on interfacial pH and CO2 concentration. As increasing the rotation rate improves mass transfer of species to and from the electrode surface, the interfacial pH becomes closer to the bulk pH while the interfacial concentration of CO2 at the electrode surface increases. However, increasing the rotation rate significantly decreased the CO2 reduction activity for constant current electrochemical CO2 reduction despite the increased availability of CO2 at the electrode surface. As the changes in interfacial pH and CO2 concentration with rotation rate cannot adequately explain the results, it is instead suggested that the enhanced mass transfer of dissolved CO away from the electrode surface at high rotation rates is the main reason behind the observed effects. We propose that this enhanced mass transfer of CO away from the electrode surface decreases the surface coverage of COads ( due to the equilibrium between COads and dissolved CO at the electrode-electrolyte interface) and limits the further reduction of COads to hydrocarbons.

Nonetheless, there are still several challenges to overcome before this technology can be applied as an industrial process. In the reaction path of the electrochemical reduction of CO2 with Cu as an electrocatalyst, it is known that carbon monoxide is the key intermediate to chemicals such as ethylene, ethanol, and n-propanol. However, a better understanding of the electrochemical reduction of CO is still necessary to improve selectivity and efficiency at high current densities. In this work, the electrochemical reduction of CO2 and CO towards C2 and C3 products is investigated using gas diffusion electrodes in a flow cell. Thereby the electrochemical reaction is not limited by the solubility of the feed gas in the electrolyte, and current densities of industrial relevance can be achieved. The electrodes are prepared using commercial Cu-powders consisting either of nano- or microparticles that are deposited on gas diffusion layers. Potentiostatic experiments show that with CO as the reactant, higher current densities for C2 and C3 products can be achieved at lower working electrode potentials compared to CO2 as the reactant. Galvanostatic CO electrochemical reduction at -300 mA cm(-2 )with Cu-nanoparticles (40-60 nm) results in a cumulative Faradaic efficiency of 89% for C2 and C3 products. This represents a two-fold increase in selectivity to ethylene and a three-fold increase towards ethanol and n-propanol compared to the selectivity obtained with CO2 as the reactant. This enhancement of selectivity for C2 and C3 products at current densities of industrial relevance with CO as reactant provides a new perspective regarding a two-step electrochemical reduction of CO2.

Herein, nanostructured self-supporting Cu electrodes with Cu foam as the substrate, with progressive morphologies of nanowires (CuNW), nanosheets (CuNS) and nanoflowers (CuNF), are in-situ prepared by simply adjusting the reaction time in a strongly alkaline oxidizing solution. It is found that the performance and products distribution of ERCD are affected by both the morphology of the as prepared nanostructured self-supporting Cu electrodes and the electrolyte species. As electrode micromorphology evolves from nanowire to nanoflower, the initial electrode potential required for C-2 products generation shifts to more positive values. The CuNS electrode shows the highest Faradaic efficiency (FE) of 86.9% at -0.4 V (vs. RHE) and superior performance, owing to its nanosheet morphology that can better stabilize the intermediate state products. Moreover, both total FE and products distribution are affected by the electrolyte anion species. The highest total FE in the investigated electrolyte on CuNS electrode obeys the following order: KHCO3 (86.9%, -0.4 V (vs. RHE)) > KCl (54.7%, -0.5 V (vs. RHE)) > KH2PO4 (1.0%, -0.9 V (vs. RHE)).

The generation of products and the said distribution depend on the various methods and materials like catalysts, electrodes, electrolytes, selectively proton permeable membrane used in the reduction process, numbers of available hydrogen ions at the cathodic catalytic surface and its adsorption characteristics on the catalysts surface dispersed on the cathode. Copper (Cu) and cuprous oxide (Cu2O) nanocatalysts have been synthesized and characterized by X-ray Diffraction (XRD), Transmission Electron Microscopy (TEM), and Field Emission Scanning Electron Microscopy (FESEM) for finding the differences in their surface characteristics in order to explain the selectivity of product in their use as catalysts. The efficacy of the reduction process with the synthesized catalysts is studied in the customized electrolytic cell. Methanol is selectively produced by using Cu2O nanocatalyst as a cathode in an aqueous electrolyte, potassium bicarbonate (KHCO3), whereas methane and ethylene are formed predominantly with Cu nanocatalysts. The cathodic potential applied to the electrolytic cell with Cu2O as a catalyst on the cathode is optimized at -2.0 V vs. SHE for both the methanol selectivity and also for the minimization of undesired hydrogen evolution. The maximum faradaic efficiency of 47.5% for methanol at a maximum current density of 7.8 mA cm(-2) is obtained with a sustained current density of 5.6 mA cm(-2) at a run time of 50 min.

Electrocatalytic reduction seems to be a very promising technology to help to reduce industrial CO2 emissions. The development of catalysts capable of activating the CO2 molecule is the main challenge of this technology. In this work a copper supported on carbon nanotubes (Cu/CNT) catalyst has been synthesized using supercritical fluid deposition (SFD) and assembled into a polymer electrolyte membrane (PEM) type cell to carry out the electrochemical reduction of CO2. The influence of current density, temperature and CO2 flowrate has been analysed and results have been compared with those previously obtained with Pt/CNT and Pb/CNT catalysts synthesized by SFD. The CO2 reduction rate and the products distribution attained with the three catalysts have been analysed. CO has been the main reaction product attained with the Cu/CNT catalyst developed in this work, followed by small amounts of formic acid and methane. This can be considered the main difference observed in relation with Pt or Pb based catalysts that promote the production of formic acid as main reaction product. CO2 conversion rate increases with temperature and CO2 flowrate and is much higher than that attained when using Pt or Pb based catalysts in the same experimental conditions (up to 27 times higher depending on the experimental conditions).

Cyclic voltammetry and chronoamperometry are used in combination with a cavity microelectrode (CME) for the first time. Low-distorted voltammetric signals obtained with the CME evidence that for alloys with low or moderate Cu content (up to 50 at%) the typical CO2RR inhibition peak, related to CO blocking Pd active sites, becomes a current plateau. Interestingly, the plateau height matches the theoretical value corresponding to the steady state current of a microdisc. This fact indicates a better tolerance of Pd100-xCux towards CO poisoning and also the attainment of a pseudo-steady state where mass transport should be controlled by diffusion. The synergy between Cu and Pd is thus established for the first time at the level of the voltammograms. The chronoamperometric responses exhibit three well defined regions corresponding to (1) double layer charging and diffusion/reaction establishment, (2) beginning of CO poisoning by formation of a CO adlayer and (3) final collapse of the catalytic activity at a critical time, t(c), which depends directly on the bimetallic composition. A plot of t(c) vs. Pd content exhibits a clear volcano shape, from which similar to Pd72Cu28 is identified as a close to optimal composition in terms of CO tolerance and Pd35Cu65 as the composition from which the advantage of alloying Pd with Cu is lost. An in-depth analysis of the I/V response and its evolution with composition and time is performed in the CO2 RR and CO stripping regions. As a result, the possibility of developing a method to further increase the catalyst lifetime based on periodical releasing of \"CO-like\" intermediates by CO stripping is proposed.

Here we incorporate reaction energetics for CO2 reduction on Cu(111) and Cu(211) determined by DFT calculations in microkinetics simulations to predict the influence of surface topology, the presence of water and possible diffusion limitations on current density-potential curves and Faradaic efficiencies. A reaction-diffusion model was used that takes into account the effect of electrochemical potential on the stability of intermediates and associated activation barriers in proton-coupled electron transfer steps as well as diffusion of protons and CO2 from the bulk electrolyte to the electrode surface. The basic model can well reproduce hydrogen evolution including the effect of proton diffusion limitations and a shift of proton reduction (low potential) to water reduction (high potential). Considering CO2 electro-reduction, the stepped Cu(211) surface is more active than the Cu(111) terrace towards HCOO(H), CO and CH4. The presence of a catalytic H2O molecule increases the overall rate and selectivity to products (CO and CH4) derived from dissociated CO2. A catalytic H2O molecule facilitates the difficult electrochemical CO2 activation step to COOH and suppresses the competing activation step towards HCOO, which mainly yields HCOO(H). In general, the current densities increase at higher negative potential and the products follow the sequence CO2 -> CO -> CH4. That is to say, CO2 is converted to CO via COOH dissociation, followed by CO hydrogenation. Trendwise, the simulated product distribution follows the potential-dependent distribution observed in experiment. The low selectivity to CH3OH can be understood from the fast electrochemical steps that lead to CHx-OH dissociation. At high overpotentials the hydrogenation step from CO2 to COOH controls both activity and selectivity towards CH4. At high potential CO2 reduction becomes increasingly diffusion-limited, thus limiting the selectivity of CO2 reduction vs. hydrogen evolution. This aspect supports the need for better design of mass transfer in electrochemical reactors, which operate at high current density. (C) 2020 The Authors.

It is known that the binding strength between the reduction intermediates and the electrocatalyst affects the selectivity of products, but how to correlate the performance with the surface composition, structure, and properties of a bimetallic electrocatalyst, instead of stoichiometric or bulk composition remains less discussed. AuCu and AuCu3 NPs with the size around similar to 8 nm were prepared. By excluding the size effect, the work studies the effects of surface composition and heteroatomic interaction on the selectivity and faradaic efficiency of the reduction products. Based on X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS), one can quantify the alloying extent and surface compositions of electrocatalysts, which are supposed to have the pivotal effects on the reaction pathways and the corresponding reduction products. It is found that high activity and notably improved CO selectivity of Au-Cu bimetallic NPs can be attributed to the heterometallic coordination and their electronic interactions.

An upshift of the d-band center and opposite binding energy shifts of Cu and Pd core levels were experimentally observed using X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). This perturbation of the surface electronic structure of the CuPd/C nanoparticles leads to the lowering of the bonding strength of key adsorbate species for both the formate oxidation and electrochemical CO2 reduction, which increased the catalytic activity toward both reactions.

Crystalline nanosheets of this compound that show a preferential [00I] facet orientation exhibit undiminished CO2 RR activity after 16 hours with full retention of crystal structure and surface chemical speciation and no detectable corrosion. In contrast to the range of products formed on Cu metal, CuO, and Cu2O, the CO2RR on Cu3P [00I] produces mainly hydrogen and formate as the sole carbon product in KHCO3 electrolyte. Analysis of the Cu3P [00I] facet by HAADF-STEM was used to determine the surface lattice structure, while both XPS and Auger spectroscopies were used to determine the surface chemical speciation from the kinetic energies of ionized electrons. The presented analysis identifies isolated trigonal CuP3 sites on the Cu3P[00I]-Cu3P3 terminated surface and the Cu(I) oxidation state as precursor to the active catalyst. The CO2 RR selectivity to formate and the higher turnover rate for H-2 production on the [00I] facet allows a structure-activity analysis and chemical mechanism to be proposed.

However, there are still few efficient catalysts for CO2RR-to-syngas electrolysis. Herein, a density functional theory (DFT) study of the Cu-M (M = Cd, Zn, Ni, Ag, and Pd) bimetal catalysts (BMCs) for CO2RR and HER is reported. The results indicate that the reaction barrier is significantly changed in the electrochemical conversion of CO2 into CO and HER by changing the Cu/M ratio. d band center (epsilon(d)) has a good linear relationship with Delta G(H*), Delta G(COOH*) and Delta Ge-CO*, so epsilon(d) is a good descriptor for hydrogen reduction reaction (HER) and carbon dioxide reduction reaction (CO2 RR) activity. The Cu-Pd catalyst displays outstanding catalytic activity for HER and CO2RR. HER activity of the Cu-Pd catalyst is even comparable to that of the current most effective Pt catalysts. Compared with other catalysts with different Cu/M ratios (Cu/M = 0.5 and Cu/M = 2), the Cu-Cd catalyst at low Cu/Cd ratio (0.5) is the only catalyst which is more favorite to CO2RR than HER. This theoretical study may provide guidance to design the effective electrocatalysts for the CO2RR and HER, and shed light on the application of Cu-based bimetal materials in syngas production.\nDoi:10.1016_j.fuel.2021.121341", "label": []}

All metal complexes have square planar geometries and crystallize in the P2(1)/c space group. Structural characterization of the ligand shows contribution of the bis(ketone) tautomer in the crystalline phase, in agreement with density functional theory (DFF) computations. However, according to the UV-vis spectrum, there is a stronger influence of the bis(phenol) tautomer in solution. Cyclic experiments showed that the ligand undergoes a single irreversible oxidation process at 0.434 V (vs Fc/Fc(+)) while the complexes with Co2+, Ni2+ and Cu2+ suffer electroxidative process on the surface of the working electrode in addition to solution-assigned redox processes. The CoL oxidation is localized on the metal center, however, the CuL and NiL oxidations are considered as metal-ligand based processes. DFT calculations confirmed our experimental findings.

Here, the single-, double-, and triple-atomic Cu embedded graphdiyne (Cu1-3@GDY) complexes have been systematically modeled by first-principles computations to evaluate the corresponding electric structures and catalytic performance. The results revealed that these Cu-1-(3)@GDY monolayers possess high thermal stability by forming the firm Cu-C bonds. The Cu-1-(3)@GDY complexes exhibit good electrical conductivity, which could promote the charge transfer in the electroreduction process. The electronic and magnetic interactions between key species (*H, *COOH, and *OCHO) and Cu1-3@GDY complexes are responsible for the different catalytic performance of HER and CO2RR on different Cu-1-(3)@GDY sheets. The Cu-2@GDY complex could efficiently convert CO2 to CH4 with a rather low limiting potential of -0.42 V due to the spin magnetism of catalysts. The Cu-1@CDY and CuAGDY exhibit excellent HER catalytic performance, and their limiting potentials are -0.18 and -0.02 V, respectively.

The role of water solvation on CO2 reduction paths was explored by evaluating waterassisted surface hydrogenation and proton (H) shuttling with various solvation models. Electrochemical O-H bond formation reactions occur through water-assisted H-shuttling, whereas C H bond formation occurs with negligible H2O involvement via direct reaction with adsorbed H* on the Cu(1 1 1) surface. The DFT-computed kinetic path shows that the experimentally observed production of methane and ethylene on Cu(1 1 1) catalysts occurs through the reduction of carbon monoxide (CO*) to a hydroxymethylidyne (COH*) intermediate. Methane is produced from the reduction of the COH* to C* and then sequential hydrogenation. Ethylene production shares the COH* path with methane production, where the methane to ethylene selectivity depends on CH2*, and H* coverages. The reported potential-dependent activation barriers provide kinetics consistent with observed experimental reduction overpotentials and selectivity to methane and ethylene over methanol for the electroreduction of CO2 on Cu catalysts.

In this work, the thermochemical and electrochemical CO2 reduction pathways are systematically studied on the (111) facet of an octahedral copper (Cuss) nanocluster (NC) using density functional theory (DFT) calculations. An investigation is carried out to understand the catalytic activity of the Cu NC towards CO2 reduction to explore its activity and product selectivity (CH3OH vs. CH4; i.e., six-electron vs. eight-electron reduction reaction). Interestingly, CO2 adsorbs strongly the (111) facet of the Cu NC, as opposed to the previous reports on the periodic Cu (1 1 1) surfaces. Furthermore, such NC shows excellent catalytic activity towards direct C-O bond dissociation, which is again in contrary to what was reported in the literatures. Besides, the CO2 hydrogenation reaction has been investigated using different proton transfer mechanisms (surface-hydrogenation, water-assisted, and water solvated) with/without the help of a solvent water molecule. We find that the water-assisted H-shuttling mechanism lowers the activation barrier significantly and thus favours the CO2 hydrogenation. However, the direct C-O bond dissociation is very competing with respect to indirect C-O bond dissociation. Based on our reaction free energy calculations, activation barrier calculations, and simulated Pourbaix calculations, we find that the Cu NC shows excellent catalytic activity and selectivity over any catalysts studied to date. Besides, the Cu NC requires a lower overpotential (0.53 V) compared to the periodic Cu(1 1 1) surface (0.71 V) and thus can be a promising catalyst for CO2 reduction reaction. (C) 2017 Elsevier Inc.

We proposed that GCN and strain can be used as the predictive descriptors correlating the structural properties of Cu-based catalysts to its catalytic performance in CRR. By coupling of GCN and strain effects, we predicted that the octahedral Au@Cu core shell nanoparticle could lower the overpotentials to convert CO2 into CH4.

However, it is still a great challenge in large-scale synthesis of electrocatalysts for C2+ compounds production with high selectivity and rate in neutral electrolyte. In this study, a robust and scalable aqueous synthesis method was proposed to prepare CuO nanosheets, which was directly used as CO2RR electrocatalyst. The catalyst underwent dynamic restructuring during the pre-reduction stage, which significantly changed the morphology, crystalline structure and electrochemical properties of the catalyst. As a result, the pristine CuO nanosheets gradually evolved to corallike Cu nanoparticle ensembles (CL-Cu NEs). In 0.1 M KHCO3 at -1.1 V vs. RHE, the CL-Cu NEs exhibited a faradaic efficiency and partial current density of C2+ products of 72.1% and 25.2 mA cm(-2) respectively and no degradation was observed in 15 h running. In contrast to many Cu-based catalysts showing considerable C2+ products selectivity, the (sub)surface oxygen and Cu' species were unlikely to play a significant role in this study. The strong performance of CL-Cu NEs was ascribed to the synergism between the coral-like morphology and abundant Cu(1 0 0)/Cu(1 1 1) interfaces.

The current barrier to this technique is the low efficiency of C-C coupling through dimerization of adsorbed *CO or coupling of *CO with its hydrogenated derivatives over the Cu catalyst. Tandem catalysts, which integrate Cu with another CO-generation catalyst (e.g., ZnO), can enhance the C-C coupling kinetics by increasing the local concentration of the key intermediate of CO. However, the degree of enhancement is strongly dependent on the spatial manipulation of supplementary CO transport. Herein, inspired by the reactant species concentration profile in a plug flow reactor, Cu/ZnO tandem electrodes are designed by spatially adding a ZnO catalyst layer on top of the Cu catalyst layer, in which the ZnO catalyst layer fed CO concentration progressively decreases over the Cu catalyst layer. Such a spatial management of CO transport dramatically increases the CO utilization efficiency, leading to an enhancement of Faradaic efficiency and partial current density of C2+ products by 1.2 and 3.4 times, respectively, compared to the bare Cu electrode, while by 1.3 and 1.8 times, respectively, compared to the Cu&ZnO mixed electrode.

Advanced operando X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS), X-ray diffraction (XRD) and Raman spectroscopy were employed to probe the potential-dependent changes of the chemical states of Cu species in the Cu oxide foams (referred to as CuxO) before and during the CO2RR. This complementary and holistic approach of 'bulk'- and surface-sensitive techniques demonstrates that the electro-reduction of CuxO foams into metallic Cu is completed before hydrocarbon (e.g., ethylene, ethane) and alcohol (e.g., ethanol, n-propanol) formation sets in. There are, however, substantial differences in the potential dependence of the oxide reduction when comparing the 'bulk' with the respective 'surface' processes. Only in the very initial stage of the CO2RR, the reduction of the Cu oxide precursor species is temporarily superimposed on the production of CO and H-2. Complementary identical location (IL) SEM analysis of the CuxO foams prior to and after the CO2RR reveals a significant alteration in the surface morphology caused by the appearance of smaller Cu nanoparticles formed by the reduction process of CuxO species.

Two critical issues involved in electrochem-ical reaction mechanism are investigated: 1) competing concerted and sequential proton-electron trans-fer pathways, 2) competing thermodynamics-controlled and kinetics-controlled pathways. Our results show that the electrochemical reduction of CO2 to CO and HCOOH adopts a thermodynamics-controlled CPET mechanism at low pH, while follows a kinetics-controlled SPET mechanism at high pH. The electrocatalytic activity and selectivity can be effectively modulated by manipulating of solution pH and electrode potential. It is demonstrated that HCOOH is the main product at low overpotential while CO becomes the main product at high overpotential. In addition, increasing pH is conducive to improving the Faradic efficiency of HCOOH production and suppressing the hydrogen evolution reaction. (C) 2020 Elsevier Inc.

In this work, Cu2+ was embedded into a polycondensation structure of resorcinol (R) and formaldehyde (F) via sol-gel reaction, and the complex was then calcined at high temperature to obtain copper nanoparticles-dispersed carbon aerogels (Cu/CA). The samples were further activated sequentially under CO2 and N-2 atmosphere. The final products under different activation temperature of secondary N-2 atmosphere were obtained and marked as Cu/CA-CO2-N-2-T. The existence of highly dispersed Cu-0 on the carbon aerogels was confirmed by XPS and HRTEM, which exhibited attractive activity towards electrochemical CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR) forming carbon product in 0.1 M KHCO3 aqueous media. Furthermore, the CO2 RR product distribution varied under different samples. The sample activated under 700 degrees C (Cu/CA-CO2-N-2-700) with Cu loading c.a. 5.13 wt% showed remarkable CO faradaic efficiency (FE) (75.6%) at low overpotential of -0.49 V. Further calcination led to more exposure of copper, and CO dimerization to C2 product. The high selectivity toward CO by Cu/CA-CO2-N-2-700 maybe attributed to their excellent stability in maintaining the metallic nature of Cu component within the hydrophobic carbon aerogels during electrocatalysis, which further prevents the adsorption and reduction of CO on the catalyst.

Electrocatalytic materials with reduced overpotential and high efficiency and selectivity are exploited for further development.

Herein, a self-assembly strategy, along with CO2 gas as acidifying agent, to fabricate silk fibroin (SF) derived carbon aerogels (CA) combining trace copper nanoparticles (SF-Cu/CA) is developed. Zinc nitrate was introduced as a pore-forming agent to further optimize the pore structure of the as-prepared catalysts to form SF-Cu/CA-1. The rich mesoporous structure and unique constitute of SF-Cu/CA-1 is conducive to exposed numerous active sites, fast electron transfer rate, and the desorption of *CO intermediate, thus leading to the electrocatalytic CO2RR of SF-Cu/CA-1 catalyst with an excellent current density of 29.4 mA cm(-2), Faraday efficiency of 83.06% towards carbon monoxide (CO), high the ratio value of CO/H2 (19.58), and a long-term stability over a 10-hour period.

Nonetheless, due to the intrinsic inertness of CO2 at ambient conditions, the electrocarboxylation efficiency has been quite limited, typically with high applied potentials and low current densities. In this work, we demonstrate that nitrogen-coordinated single-atomic copper sites on carbon framework (Cu/N-C) served as an excellent electrocatalyst for electrocarboxylation of styrene with CO2. The Cu/N-C catalyst allowed to efficiently activate CO2, followed by nucleophilic attack to carboxylate styrene to produce phenylsuccinic acid, thus leading the reaction toward the CO2 activation pathway. The enhanced CO2 activation capability enabled increased selectivity and activity for electrocarboxylation of styrene. The Faradaic efficiency of electrocarboxylation was 92%, suggesting most of the activated CO2 proceeded to react with styrene rather than direct reduction to CO or CH4. The electrocarboxylation exhibited almost 100% product selectivity toward phenylsuccinic acid, with a high partial current density of 58 mA.cm(-2) at -2.2 V (vs. Ag/AgI), corresponding to an outstanding production rate of 216 mg.cm(-2).h(-1), substantially exceeding previously reported works.

The results showed that the use of pyridine-based soluble co-catalysts lowered the overpotential for the electrochemical reduction of CO2, enhancing also reaction performance (i.e. reaction rate and Faradaic efficiency). Reaction outcome is discussed on the basis of the role that Nligands play on the mechanism and the inductive effect caused by the electron-releasing or electronwithdrawing substituents of the aromatic ring. In particular, the maximum methanol formation rate and Faradaic efficiency reached at the 2-methylpyridine (with electron-releasing substituents)-based system with a pH of 7.6 and an applied current density of j = 1 mA cm(2) were r = 2.91 mu mol m(2) s(1) and FE = 16.86%, respectively.

Till now Cu has been found the best electrocatalyst for ERC but still the potential of Cu is not fully explored. This paper illustrates the effect of electrocatalyst layer formed by four different morphologies of cupper (nanorods, octahedral, spherical, and dendrite) with similar crystallite phases. Pre and post-ERC analysis of the catalyst in different environment shows that same crystal facet is formed at the end of ERC, indicating that the crystal rearrangement occurred during ERC is independent of the environment and does not promote any particular reaction. Nanorods form intercalated layers with an extended surface giving maximum faradaic efficiency of 26% at a lower cell voltage of - 2.75 V. Dendrites forms porous layers, which are filled by the gas formed during ERC and thus decreases the active surface. However, the entrapped intermediates provide sufficient residence time and conditions for C2H4 and C2H6 formation.

Among the different value-added products, formic acid or formate is particularly attractive since it can be used as a fuel for low-temperature fuel-cells and as a renewable hydrogen carrier. Very recently, a rapidly increasing number of studies have revealed Bi as a promising electrocatalytic material for the CO2 electroreduction to formate, but the performance of Bi electrodes operating in a continuous mode and high current density (j) has been hardly investigated yet. Thus, this work aims at studying the CO2 electroreduction to formate working in a continuous mode in a filter-press-reactor at a j up to 300 mA.cm(-2) using Bi electrodes. Bismuth Gas Diffusion Electrodes (Bi-GDEs) were fabricated from carbon-supported Bismuth-nanoparticles. The influence of j and the electrolyte flow/area ratio in the performance of the Bi-GDEs towards formate were evaluated.

We show here for the first time how a dendritic-type nano-morphology and related fractal dimension plays a crucial role in determining the selectivity for electrodes based on Cu and Fe. The electrodes, prepared by electrodeposition of Cu or Fe on metal substrates (Cu, Ti, Al, Fe, Fe-Cr-Ni alloy) or carbon-based gas diffusion layers (GDL), were tested in a continuous flow cell at constant potential ( - 1.5 V vs. Ag/AgCl) or at the onset potential of the first cathodic peak determined by cyclic voltammetry. Results showed that the dendritic-type nano-morphology influences positively not only the activity to formic acid, but especially the selectivity to gas products (i.e. CH4 and CO) and to higher carbon-chain liquid products (i.e. ethanol, isopropanol, acetic acid) when smoother edges and denser surface sites are present.

In this type of proposed cascade electrocatalytic operation, CO is produced in a first step and subsequently reduced to multi-carbon products in a second step with significantly higher Faradaic efficiencies compared to a one-step process. Research efforts have been focused on the feasibility of the isolated second step with pure CO as reactant, however the interdependencies of both steps need to be considered. Accordingly, two-step electrochemical reduction of CO2 is studied in this work as an integrated system. Taking into account that the study of this technology at high current densities is crucial for industrial applicability, gas diffusion electrodes and flow-cells were used for operation at current densities above - 200 mA cm(-2). Firstly, each step was characterized separately, the first using a silver gas diffusion electrode to generate a mixture of humidified CO, H-2, and unreacted CO2; the second step using copper nanoparticles on a carbon-based gas diffusion structure to obtain C-2 and C-3 products. This step was studied using synthetic mixtures of CO2 and CO with different ratios. Furthermore, experiments with isotope labeled (CO2)-C-13 and (CO)-C-13 were performed in order to obtain some insights on the (electrochemical) reaction path of gas mixtures containing CO2 and CO. Subsequently, the two units were integrated into a system, where the full gas output of the first unit was directly fed to the second unit. The total Faradaic efficiency towards multi-carbon products of this initial system was limited to 20% at total current density of - 470 mA cm(-2). These initial results together with the isotopic labeling studies indicate that the presence of significant amounts of unreacted CO2 from the first step is detrimental for the second step. A significant improvement was achieved by introducing a CO2 absorption column between the two units and after splitting the overall charge flow applied in each cell in accordance with the main reaction at each step. With this set-up a total Faradaic efficiency towards C-2 and C-3 products of 62% at a total current density of - 300 mA cm(-2) was achieved.

In addition, the material used in preparing this catalyst is widely accessible at low cost. Among the electrocatalysts tested, Cu1.81S@WMCNT-600-OD exhibits a high CO2 selectivity towards formate at an overpotential of 0.45 V with high faradaic efficiency (82 %) for nearly 20 h. Further investigations reveal that the needle-like dendritic structure formed during electrolysis is the likely source for the improved performance in CO2 reduction.

Copper (Cu) is the most effective metal catalyst with selectivity towards hydrocarbons but Cu catalyst alone generally produces hydrocarbons at low selectivity and yield. Operando surface enhanced infrared absorption spectroscopic (SEIRAS) analysis reveals that the low hydrocarbon yield is attributed to the poor ability of Cu to produce carbon monoxide (CO), which is a crucial intermediate for hydrocarbon formation. In the current study, an Ag-Cu dual-cathode CO2RR device is developed, which allows separate control of electrode potential. This dual-cathode cell shows increased hydrocarbon yield (83 % for methane and 106 % for ethylene) and a 200 mV lower onset potential for C2H4, compared to electrolysis with a single Cu cathode. The CO produced by the Ag cathode transfers to Cu and increase its CO coverage, facilitating methane formation as well as promoting C?C coupling to form ethylene. This study also reveals a mismatch of optimum electrode potential between Ag and Cu, which results in compromised performance of the two components in an Ag-Cu bimetallic electrocatalyst, but poses no challenge in the dual-cathode cell. To optimize the performance of the dual-cathode cell, we propose the use of a single-pass dual-gas-diffusion-cathode reactor with enhanced mass transfer for maximum hydrocarbon production.

The formation of a solid solution in the bimetallic Pd-based compounds was confirmed by a contraction of the Pd unit cell volume, measurements of the TEM interplanar distance, and cyclic voltammetry characterization. Pd-based electrocatalysts presented smaller crystallite sizes (9 nm?18 nm) than Cu2O/C and SnOX/C (62 nm and 82 nm, respectively). Pd/C, Pd-Cu2O/C, and Pd-SnO2/C showed the highest electrochemical activity to perform the CO2RR due to a lower overpotential value compared to Cu2O/C and SnOX/C. The Tafel plots during CO2RR revealed a small slope in the region of lower overpotentials for the Pdbased electrocatalysts (less than 52 mV dec-1), which indicates a better kinetic compared to Cu2O/C and SnOX/C (165 and 193 mV dec-1, respectively). SnOX presented the highest selectivity toward HER instead of CO2 reduction. DEMS measurements allowed the determination of the selectivity for the electrocatalysts to produce specific CO2 reaction products. Pd-based materials are suitable to perform the CO2RR since bimetallic electrocatalyst (Pd-Cu2O/C and Pd-SnO2/C) generates CO, formic acid, and CH4 as reaction products.

The influence of the applied current and temperature on the electro-catalytic activity and selectivity of these materials was investigated. Among the two investigated electrodes, the pure Cu catalyst film showed the highest CO2 specific electrocatalytic reduction rates and higher selectivity to methanol formation compared to the Cu-C electrode, which was attributed to the higher particle size of the former and lower CuO/Cu ratio. The obtained results show potential interest for the possible use of electrical renewable energy for the transformation of CO2 into valuable products using low metal loading Cu based electrodes (0.5 mg Cu cm(-2)) prepared by sputtering.

Here, we present a potentiostatic pulse-electrodeposition of high-aspect-ratio CuxAuy nanowire arrays (NWAs) as high-performance electrocatalysts for the CO2 reduction reaction (CO2 RR). The surface electronic structure related to the Cu:Au ratio in the CuxAuy NWAs could be facilely modulated by controlling the electrodeposition potential and the as-fabricated CuxAuy NWAs could be directly used as the catalytic electrode for the CO2RR. The morphology of the high-aspect-ratio nanowire array significantly lowers the onset potential of the alcohol formation due to the diffusion-induced enhancement of the local pH and CO concentration near the nanowire surface. Besides, the properly adjusted surface electronic structure of the CuxAuy NWA enables the adsorption of CO and facilitates the subsequent CO reduction to ethanol via the C-C coupling pathway. Owing to the synergistic effect of morphology and electronic structure, the optimized CuxAuy NWA selectively reduces CO2 to ethanol at low potentials of -0.5--0.7 V vs. RHE with a highest Faradaic efficiency of 48%. This work demonstrates the feasibility to optimize the activity and selectivity of the Cu-based electrocatalysts toward multicarbon alcohols for the CO2RR via simultaneous adjustment of the electronic structure and morphology of the catalysts.

However, the limited conductivity and stability become the stumbling-block that prevents the development of it. The exploring of MOFs-derived M-C materials starts a new chapter for the MOFs precursors, which provides a remarkable electronic connection between carbon matrix and metals/metal oxides. N-doped M-N-C with extensive M-N sites scattering into the carbon matrix are more popular because of their impressive contribution to catalytic activity and specific product selectivity. Nevertheless, Cu-N-C system remained undeveloped up to now. The lack of ideal precursor, the sensitivity of Cu to be oxidized, and the difficulties in the synthesis of small size Cu nanoparticles are thus known as the main barriers to the development of Cu-N-C electrocatalysts. Herein, a nitrogen-rich Cu-BTT MOF is employed for the derivation of N-doped Cu-N-C(tau)( )composite electrocatalysts by the pyrolyze method.

This is caused by the deposition of poisonous compounds such as graphitic carbon. To settle this problem, we have developed an electrolysis system in which CO2 is reduced at the three-phase (gas\\liquid\\solid) interface on a Cu-mesh electrode. In the present study, a Cu-mesh electrode is modified beforehand by copper(I) halides, and CO2 is reduced at a constant potential with these modified electrodes in an acidic solution of potassium halide. The Faradaic efficiency for C2H4 is considerably increased and reversely that for H-2 is decreased by confining a copper(I) halide. In the case of CuBr, the conversion of CO2 to C2H4 and the hydrogen evolution are observed with Faradaic efficiencies of about 80% and 9%, respectively. Such a contribution of copper(I) halide to the CO2 reduction is related to its reversible combination with CO and C2H4. At the three-phase interface, CO2(g) is first reduced to CO2(g). This gas is ready to adsorb to copper(I) halide with its pi-bond perpendicular to the surface, and the CO is subjected to electron injection from the electrode to be reduced to the methylene radical. The coupling of methylene radicals results in the formation of C2H4 and this product is stabilized by adsorbing to copper(I) halide with its pi-bond parallel to the surface. (C) 2003 Elsevier B.V.

However, we observed the production of hydrocarbons via CO2RR on commercial Cu films is less efficient because of the surface impurities, i.e., Fe. Carbon monoxide (CO), a reaction intermediate of CO2RR to hydrocarbons, binds strongly to the Fe sites and interrupts the production of hydrocarbons, resulting in an active hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). Herein, we report a method of blocking the effect of Fe impurities on the Cu surface through the preferential growth of nano-sized metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) on Fe site. When zirconium (Zr)-based MOFs (UiO-66) forms a compensating layer on Cu film via the terephthalic acid (TPA)-Fe coordination bond, the UiO66 coated Cu film (UiO-66@Cu) presents significantly improved hydrocarbon Faradaic efficiency (FE) of 37.59% compared to 14.68% FE on commercial Cu film (99.9% purity) by suppressing HER. According to X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) analysis, the UiO-66 ligand binds to entire metallic Fe site on the Cu surface, while metallic Cu is retained. Thus, UiO-66@Cu provides active sites of Cu for CO2RR and leads to highly efficient and selective production of hydrocarbons.

CO2 was bubbled into the solution at 0 V vs. Ag/AgCl, i.e., on an oxidized copper surface. In acidic solutions (pH around 2.5), at -0.2 V, bands indicative of the presence of ethylene on the electrode surface were detected. Although ethylene is knowledgably a product of CO2 electroreduction on copper, it was not experimentally identified on the electrode's surface at such a low cathodic potential in prior works. In solutions with pH around 2.5, CO bands were not observed, suggesting that hydrocarbons could be formed by a pathway that does not occur via adsorbed CO. In solutions with higher pHs, a complex spectral pattern, between 800 and 1700 cm(-1), was observed at approximately -0.4 V. The observed spectrum closely resembles those reported in the literature for adsorption of monocarboxylic acids with small chains. The spectral features indicate the presence of a structure containing a double C=C bond. a carboxyl group, and C-H bonds on the electrode's surface. SERS spectra obtained in CO-saturated solution are also presented. However, in this case, no SERS bands were observed in the region between 800 and 1700 cm(-1) at low cathodic potentials.

Significant advances have already been achieved in understanding how some characteristics of copper electrodes, the current state-of-the-art catalyst for multi-carbon formation via CO2RR, affect the product spectrum. Advances and insights have been reported for, among others, the effect of crystallographic orientation, active surface area, and composition of M-copper (M = Au, Ag, Zn, etc.) materials, and how these alter the distribution of CO2RR products.

In this paper, we have systematically investigated the effect of the roughness factor, chemical composition, and surface morphology of CuxZny electrocatalysts on the product distribution during CO2RR. Firstly, Cu, Cu90Zn10, and Cu75Zn25 electrodes were exposed to oxidation-reduction cycles to produce Cu and CuxZny electrodes with different morphologies, roughness factors, and chemical composition.

In this article, we report the effects of microstructure of Sn catalyst layer on the Faradaic efficiency towards formate formation as a function of Nafion loading, thickness of the catalyst layer, and catalyst particle size. Electrode with 17-20 wt.% Nafion was found to exhibit the highest partial current density towards the formation of formate when the average particle size of Sn catalysts ranged from 100 nm to 1.5 mu m. This Nafion fraction is lower than what was reported, 30-36 wt.%, in the cathode of proton exchange membrane fuel cells. Moreover, the partial current density for formate formation was observed to increase with the thickness of catalyst layer, but eventually saturated because the reaction zone was limited by mass transfer. The Faradaic efficiency towards the formation of formate exhibited nearly thickness-independence due to the counteractive effects caused by increasing local proton concentration and decreasing electrical field when catalyst layer thickness was increased.

Cu-based electrocatalysts have drawn noteworthy attention due to their capability to produce C-1, and C2+ products. However, challenges still exist in materials design towards highly active, selective and stable CeC coupling to produce high value-added fuels and chemicals. Meanwhile, CO2RR is a typical electrochemical reaction that occurs on the gas-liquid-solid three phase contact, therefore mass transportation stands as a key factor that influences both the activity as well as selectivity. Consequently, many efforts have been made towards the development of catalysts, electrolyte and electrochemical cell systems, to optimize the intrinsic activity and selectivity as well as mass transfer behavior. The goal of this review is to provide in-depth understanding on active sites engineering of the Cu based electrocatalysts and mass transfer ability of the cell configuration. In the first part, strategies to regulate the coordination state and electronic structure of Cu atoms were introduced for the optimization of the binding strength of key intermediates such as *CO, *CHO and *OCCO, and for the regulation of intermediates adsorption approach such as the ratio of atop-bound CO to bridge-bound CO, as well as to increase CO* coverages and lower the CO* dimerization barrier. In the second part, the design of new electrode structures and electrocatalytic cells to tune the mass transfer behavior of CO2RR reagents to enable unobstructed CO2 diffusion pathway and altered protons supply for the improvement of the activity at low overpotential and selectivity at high current density have been systematically discussed.

The interaction between copper and oxygen has always been inevitable in the design of copper-based catalysts owing to the intrinsic activity of copper and the oxygen-rich environment we live in.

In this work, we have successfully created a series of bimetallic CuSn nanowires (NWs) with modulated phases and structures as superior electrocatalysts for CO2RR. Three distinct CuSn NWs, namely, CuSn NWs/C-Air, CuSn NWs/C-H-2 and CuSn NWs/C-N-2, have been created by the combination of hydrothermal process and controlled thermal treatment in different atmospheres, where the optimized CuSn NWs/C-Air shows significant enhanced activity with the best formate selectivity of 90.2% at -1.0 V versus reversible hydrogen electrode under alkaline condition, which is much higher than those of CuSn NWs/C-H-2 (62.6%) and CuSn NWs/C-N-2 (64.3%). Moreover, the unique CuSn NWs/C-Air also exhibits enhanced stability without significant activity and selectivity degradation after continuous operating about 10 h. Density functional theory calculations reveal that Sn atoms doping into CuO(111) surface, enhancing the adsorption of CO2 intermediate *OCHO and suppressing H-2 production, could be the plausible site to realize the high selective CO2RR observed in CuSn NWs/C-Air.

Ag and Cu remain fully phase-segregated in the as deposited bimetallic foam exhibiting a high degree of dispersion of pure nm-sized Ag domains embedded in the Cu matrix. An activation of this bimetallic material towards ethanol formation is achieved by thermal annealing of the as deposited foam under mild conditions (200 degrees C for 12 h). Such annealing quantitatively transforms the Cu in the bimetallic system into a mixture of crystalline Cu2O and amorphous CuO whereas the Ag remains in its metallic state due to the thermal instability of Ag2O above temperatures of 180 degrees C. The selective oxidation of Cu in the bimetallic Ag15Cu85 catalyst goes along with an enrichment of Cu oxides on the surface of the formed mixed AgCuxO foam. Both operando X-ray diffraction and operando Raman spectroscopy demonstrate, however, that the oxide reduction is completed before the electrochemical CO2 reduction sets in. The thus formed oxide-derived (OD) bimetallic Ag15Cu85 foam catalyst shows high selectivity towards alcohol formation with Faradaic efficiencies of FEEtOH = 33.7% and FEn-PrOH = 6.9% at -1.0 V and -0.9 V vs RHE, respectively. Extended electrolysis experiments (100 h) indicate a superior degradation resistance of the oxide-derived bimetallic catalyst which is ascribed to the effective suppression of the C1 hydrocarbon reaction pathway thus avoiding irreversible carbon contaminations appearing in particular during methane production.\nDoi:10.1016_j.nanoen.2019.104331", "label": [[62, 69, "C2H5OH"], [910, 975, "CuOx-MOx"], [1398, 1403, "Faradaic efficiency"], [992, 1065, "structure control"]]}

Among the different actions proposed for mitigation of CO2 emissions, electrocatalytic reduction appears as a very promising technology for recycling CO2 to synthetic fuels and other valuable products. One of the most important challenges of this technology is the development of catalysts that allow obtaining high efficiencies in the reduction of the CO2 molecule. This work is focused in the development of Cu based nanostructured catalysts deposited on carbon supports. Supercritical fluid deposition (SFD) technique has been used for the copper deposition on three different carbon supports: carbon black (CB), carbon nanotubes (CNT) and reduced graphene oxide (rGO). SFD is an environmentally friendly technology that has demonstrated good results in the synthesis of nanomaterials. Results obtained in this work show that SFD technique allows a homogeneous deposition of copper nanoparticles on the different carbon supports used with deposition yields close to 90%. The average size of copper nanoparticles formed is between 13 and 19 nm. The activity of these catalysts (Cu/CB, Cu/CNT and Cu/rGO) in the electrocatalytic reduction of carbon dioxide has been carried out in gas phase in a PEM type electrochemical cell. Results show a higher CO2 conversion rate (around 40%) when using Cu/CNT catalyst. In every case, CO, formic acid and methane are the main reaction products obtained from the CO2 reduction. Nevertheless, Cu/CNT and Cu/CB catalysts promote the formation of CO, whereas formic acid is the main reaction product with Cu/rGO. This could be attributed to the presence of oxygenated groups observed in the rGO based catalyst.

The calculations performed in this study generally show that the intermediates in CO2 reduction are most stabilized by the (211) facet, followed by the (100) facet, with the (111) surface binding the adsorbates most weakly. This leads to the prediction that the (211) facet is the most active surface among the three in producing CH4 from CO2, as well as the by-products H-2 and CO. HCOOH production may be mildly enhanced on the more close-packed surfaces ((111) and (100)) as compared to the (211) facet, due to a change in mechanism from a carboxyl intermediate to a formate intermediate.

Theoretical contribution to probable mechanisms\nAbstract:The electrocatalyzed reduction of carbon dioxide was investigated with cobalt(II), nickel(II) and copper(II) complexes of hexaazamacrocycle ligands. The macrocyclic ligands were obtained via the condensation of phenanthroline or bipyridine. The X-ray structure of a triflate derivative was determined and it showed the less common \"CuN4O2\" centrosymmetric octahedral configuration with apically elongated Cu-O bonds. A preference for a neutral, mononuclear, octahedral configuration is exhibited by the planar macrocycle with an extended pi-electron system. Its structure is characterized by shorter Cu-N bonds than those of Cu complexes with saturated macrocycles. The reduction of the complexes has been studied by cyclic voltammetry and UV-Vis spectroscopy. The results show that the metal center in its lower oxidation state, i.e. M(l), is the active site. The metal center is oxidized to M(II) in the presence Of CO2 with the concomitant formation of an adduct between the metal center and M. A further one electron reduction regenerates the catalyst and produces carbon monoxide and/or formic acid. A theoretical model is proposed for a simple mechanism that involves initial coordination of CO2 to the metal center. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science B.V.

In this paper, we present linear sweep voltammetry results at different temperatures, different KHCO3 concentrations, and different CO2 pressures that provide important information about the CO2 reduction pathway. In experiments under CO2 at different temperatures, we obtained data that confirm the existence Of COad as an intermediate of the reduction of CO2 over Cu surfaces. In addition, voltammetry experiments at KHCO3 concentrations between 0.01 and 2.0 M confirmed the theory that the increased pH created near the electrode surface during the reduction process is being lowered by the neutralization reaction by KHCO3. Also, we present a mechanism in which COad is displaced from the Cu surface in solutions pressurized with CO2 (30-250 psi or 2-17.2 bar).

However, one of most serious problems in a practical use of this process is that this electrode loses its catalytic activity for the reduction of CO2 to hydrocarbons owing to the deposition of poisoning species in a short time after the start of electrolysis.

Copper single crystals were grown from 99.999% copper metal in a graphite crucible, and the crystal orientation was determined by the X-ray back reflection method. The surface treatment of the copper single crystal electrodes was studied in detail, and the reproducibility of the CO? reduction was greatly improved. The product distribution of the CO2 reduction varies greatly with the crystal orientation. CO2 reduction at the Cu(110) (= Cu(S)-[2(111) x (111)]) electrode gives a current yield of 20% of CH3COOH; the formation of CH3COOH in CO2 reduction has not been reported previously. The yield of CH4 was very low (6%) at the Cu(I 10) electrode. The formation of CH4 and CH3COOH changes significantly with the crystal orientation.

It was found that either solvated or nonsolvated complexes could be formed depending upon source conditions. Low cone voltage conditions enabled the formation of four- to six-coordinated complexes that were a direct reflection of the species in solution. Using precursor ion scans, it was shown that these ions were the major precursors of the 1:1 L-histidine/metal complexes. The greater number of collisions existing with higher cone voltages resulted in the loss of labile ligands, and in the case of Cu2+ in gas phase redox reactions to give MCu+ adducts. The fragmentations of 1:1 L-histidine/metal(II) complexes (namely, [(M-H)(-) Ca2+], using an ionic notation), were then studied by collisionally induced dissociation. All metal complexes were found to undergo decarboxylation. Although for Cu(II) and Zn(II), it is thought that the decarboxylated complexes, unstable, immediately dissociate by losing a reduced cation Cat(0), giving an immonium ion I-His (m/z 110). For Fe(II), Co(II), and Ni(II), the next fragmentation reactions of the stable [(M-H)(-) Ca2+ - CO2] complexes could be either loss of NH3, CH2 = NH, HCN, or Cat(0) in various proportions. Loss of the neutral metal was observed eventually in the fragmentation sequence. This was interpreted in terms of a gradual reduction of the transition metal cation, through ligand-to-metal electron transfers, related to the diminution of the coordination sphere brought on by the fragmentations. For copper, which was the only case when a reduction to MCat(+) was observed, comparison of the fragmentations of Cu(II) and Cu(I) complexes showed the oxidation state influences the reactivity.

Cu is the only single metal catalyst that can electrochemically convert CO2 into multicarbon products. However, Cu exhibits an unfavorable activity and selectivity for the generation of C-2 products because of the insufficient amount of CO* provided for the C-C coupling. Based on the strong CO2 adsorption and ultrafast reaction kinetics of CO* formation on Pd, an intimate CuPd(100) interface was designed to lower the intermediate reaction barriers and improve the efficiency of C-2 product formation. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations showed that the CuPd(100) interface enhanced the CO2 adsorption and decreased the CO2* hydrogenation energy barrier, which was beneficial for the C-C coupling. The potential-determining step (PDS) barrier of CO2 to C-2 products on the CuPd(100) interface was 0.61 eV, which was lower than that on Cu(100) (0.72 eV). Encouraged by the DFT calculation results, the CuPd(100) interface catalyst was prepared by a facile chemical solution method and characterized by transmission electron microscopy. CO2 temperature-programmed desorption and gas sensor experiments further confirmed the enhancement of the CO2 adsorption and CO2* hydrogenation ability of the CuPd(100) interface catalyst.

To do so requires efficient, selective, and stable catalysts. In this study, we report a highly mesoporous metallic Cu catalyst prepared by electrochemical reduction of thermally nitrided Cu foil. Under aqueous saturated CO2 reduction conditions, the Cu3N-derived Cu electrocatalyst produces virtually no CH4, very little CO, and exhibits a faradaic efficiency of 68% in C2+ products (C2H4, C2H5OH, and C3H7OH) at a current density of similar to 18.5 mA cm(-2) and a cathode potential of -1.0 V versus the reversible hydrogen electrode. Under these conditions, the catalyst produces more oxygenated products than hydrocarbons. We show that surface roughness is a good descriptor of catalytic performance. The roughest surface reached 98% CO utilization efficiency for C-2, product formation from CO2 reduction and the ratio of oxygenated to hydrocarbon products correlates with the degree of surface roughness.

In this work, Br-doped CuO multilamellar mesoporous nanosheets with oxygen vacancies and cetyltrimethyl ammonium (CTA(+)) cations adsorption were synthesized on Cu foam by one-step liquid-phase method at room temperature. The nanosheets with numerous mesopores and rough edges provided abundant active sites for the adsorption of CO2 molecules and brought about a long retention time for intermediates. The dopant of Br- ions induced copious oxygen vacancies on CuO lattices, thereby reducing the activation energy of CO2 molecules and optimizing intermediate species and their adsorption behaviors, while adsorbed CTA(+) cations modulated the O affinity of the Cu sites, favoring *OCH2CH3 intermediate converting to ethanol. The optimized Br1.95%-CuO can effectively catalyze CO2ER to C2H5OH in 0.1 M KHCO3. The faradaic efficiency of C2H5OH reached 53.3% with the partial current density of 7.1 mA cm(-2) at a low potential of -0.6 V.

The deposition of common electrolyte impurities such as iron, nickel, and zinc is blocked because EDTA can effectively bind the metal ions and negatively shift the electrode potential of M/Mn+. The Cu/Cu2+ redox couple is >600 mV more positive than the other metal ions and therefore participates in an equilibrium of dissolution and redeposition from and to the electrode in high concentrations of EDTA. These dynamic equilibria serve to further regenerate the surface copper catalyst to prevent the deactivation of catalytic sites.

Here, we consider the CO reduction step on Cu(111), which is critical to understanding reaction selectivity. We optimize embedding potentials at the periodic plane-wave DFT level using density functional embedding theory (DFET). All possible adsorption sites (adsites) for each adsorbate then are screened with ECW theory at the catalytically active site to refine the local electronic structure. Unsurprisingly, DFT and ECW theory predict different adsite preferences, largely because of DFT's inability to properly situate the CO 2 pi* level. Differing preferred adsites suggest that different reaction pathways could emerge from DFT versus ECW theory. Starting from these preferred ECW theory adsites, we then obtain reaction pathways at the plane-wave DFT level using the climbing-image nudged elastic band method to determine minimum energy paths. Thereafter, we perform ECW calculations at the catalytically active site to correct the energetics at each interpolated structure (image) along the reaction pathways. Via this approach, we confirm that the first step in CO reduction via hydrogen transfer on Cu(111) is to form hydroxymethylidyne (*COH) instead of formyl (*CHO). Although the prediction to preferentially form *COH is consistent with that of DFT, the two theories predict quite different structural and mechanistic behaviors, suggesting that verification is needed for other parts of the mechanism of CO2 reduction, which is the subject of ongoing work.\nDoi:10.1021_acs.jctc.0c00583", "label": []}

This process would require at least one C-C coupling of two C-1 intermediates. The (110) facet of copper is known for its ability to reduce CO2 to C2+ products in high quantities (Faradaic efficiency >= 65%). In this study, we used constant electrode potential density functional theory calculations to determine the dominant C-C coupling pathways for CO2 electrochemical reduction (CO2ER) on Cu(110). By studying the mechanism of CO2ER to methane, we identified *CO and *CH as high-concentration C-1 species due to their high Delta G* for further hydrogenation. Based on this result, 26 C-C coupling reactions that contain at least one high-concentration C-1 intermediate were selected for investigation. The most important ones responsible for C2+ formation on Cu(110) were identified, and the influence of strain on the rates of these reactions was also investigated.\nDoi:10.1021_acs.jpcc.0c10736", "label": []}

Results of theoretical calculations of the formation of these products are presented here where the transition state energy for various mechanisms is evaluated as a function of applied voltage. The calculations are based on electron density functional theory combined with searches of saddle points on the energy surface describing the system at a given voltage, and the simulated system includes a few water molecules explicitly while the rest of the dielectric is represented as a continuum. The mechanism for HCOO- formation is found to involve concerted electron and hydrogen atom transfer to CO2 while CO is formed in two concerted electron and proton transfer steps with adsorbed COOH as an intermediate. Conversion of COOH to HCOOH is not a viable process as it involves a transition state of high energy so the formation of HCOOH and CO products does not have a common intermediate but rather represents competing reaction paths. The energies of the transition states of the rate-limiting steps for these two paths are almost equal, consistent with the onset potential being similar.\nDoi:10.1021_acs.jpcc.1c01481", "label": []}

However, many aspects of the fundamental origin are still yet to be addressed at the atomic scale. Herein, we have simulated applying uniaxial lattice strain to two Cu facets with explicit water solvation for their CO2 electroreduction (CO2RR) performance. It is revealed that C-1 key reaction intermediates of CO2RR follow a reverse linear scaling relation that *COOH and *CHO are enhanced in binding strength with weaker *CO adsorption on Cu(211) and Cu(100) facets as a consequence of uniaxial lattice strain. The coupling between intrinsic lattice strain and adsorbate-induced strain to the surface site is responsible for such a relation critically determined by strain nature (i.e., compressive or tensile) and adsorption mode. The CO2RR toward CH4 production is predicted to yield the lowest limiting potential from *CO + (H+ + e(-)). *CHO on Cu(211) under 12.1% of tensile strain, but from CO2 + (H+ + e(-)). *COOH on Cu(100) under 6.3% of tensile strain.

While copper has been identified as the only monometal catalyst to exhibit appreciable performance for the production of value-added products, opportunities exist to further enhance its catalytic activity and selectivity. One such strategy is the addition of supplementary adsorbates to the copper surface, which has been found to greatly influence its CO2RR activity and selectivity. However, the mechanism behind this phenomenon remains unclear and its beneficial role is scarcely explored. Herein, we present an accurate and high-throughput screening of 289 adsorbate-pair combinations and their influence on the rate-determining steps for methane and C2+ production on copper using machine learning in conjunction with density functional theory calculations. By implementing a rigorous feature selection process, we successfully reduced the dimensionality of our feature space from 52 to less than 10, resulting in decreased prediction errors and computation time. Using the extreme gradient boosting regressor, we identified 81 and 152 unique supplementary adsorbate combinations to promote methane and C2+ production compared to pristine copper, respectively, while 80 unique combinations are shown to simultaneously improve both methane and C2+ production. Within a model accuracy of 0.082 eV, the improvements in thermodynamics for methane and C2+ production are up to 0.339 and 0.397 eV, respectively. The results of our investigation not only provide new insights into the role of supplementary adsorbates to guide future experimental and theoretical studies but also demonstrate the efficacy of using machine learning as an efficient and accurate screening tool for large combinatory systems in energy-related applications.\nDoi:10.1021_acs.jpcc.1c05004", "label": []}

In addition to demonstrating GC-DFT's ability to accurately model electrochemical processes, we also compare it with the computational hydrogen electrode (CHE) approach. GC-DFT predicts that the geometries of these reacting systems strongly depend on the applied potential, and the Helmholtz free energies vary nonlinearly with the applied potential, which contradicts a central assumption of the CHE approach. The CHE approach neglects the change in the number of electrons on the electrode surface at different applied potentials, which reduces its accuracy as the potential changes from the potential of zero charge. Our results further demonstrate that the grand free energies of the reaction intermediates not only depend on the value of the applied potential but also on the metal surface type, adsorption site, and adsorbate. GC-DFT's ability to predict the effect of the applied potential on adsorbate geometry enables it to evaluate different possible reaction mechanisms at different applied potentials. For instance, GC-DFT predicts that the first step of CO2R likely switches from proton-coupled electron transfer to sequential electron transfer and then proton transfer at more reducing potentials, a result that cannot be determined by the CHE because it assumes that all electron transfers are coupled to proton transfers and neglects the effect of the applied potential on the adsorbate geometry.\nDoi:10.1021_acs.jpcc.1c07484", "label": []}

We determined the correlations between CO adsorption energy and the other key CxHyOz intermediates adsorption energy, the overpotential, the limiting-potential elementary step, and selectivity to CH4, CH3OH, HCOOH, and H-2. The electrode efficiency decrease by OH* poisoning and the H-2 evolution is also investigated. The results demonstrate that the CO* protonation is the limiting-potential step on most surfaces, with the exception on Cu3Au and Cu3Co surfaces. In spite of the excessive strong CO* interaction on some surfaces, the overpotentials reduce when the degree of CO* adsorption energy and HCO*/COH* adsorption energy decoupling increases. The CO* adsorption energy is a good descriptor for linear scaling correlations with the other CxHyOz intermediates due to the similar charge transfer characteristics of the CO bond in CO* and those intermediates. The formic acid production can be efficiently catalyzed on Cu3Pt, Cu3Ni, Cu3Co, and Cu3(R)h surfaces. Methanol production is favorable on Cu3Pd and Cu3Pt surfaces, yet they show high overpotential (similar to 0.7 V). The key of methanol selectivity is CH2OH* intermediate formation favorability associated with the preference of CH2OH* protonation at the C atom over the O atom. The calculations reveal that the electroreduction activity on Cu-based alloys catalysts do not show a volcano-type relation as was previously found on pure metal catalysts.\nDoi:10.1021_acs.jpcc.5b01574", "label": []}

Chronoamperometry, scanning electron microscopy, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, X-ray diffraction, online gas chromatography, and nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy were used to characterize the electrochemical system and products formed. Carbon dioxide reduction using a Cu2O-derived copper working electrode gave ethylene (C2H4) and ethanol as main C-2 products, with optimized faradic efficiencies (FE) of 32.1 and 16.4% at -1.0 V vs RHE. The active catalysts were similar to 500 nm-sized crystalline Cu-0 particles, which were formed via the reduction of the Cu2O precursor during the initial phase of the CO, reduction reaction. When palladium(II) chloride was added to the electrolyte, C2H6 formation could be achieved with a significant FE of 30.1% at the said potential. The production of C2H4 was, on the other hand, suppressed to a FE of 3.4%. The alternate use of Pd-0, PdO, or Pd-Al2O3 dopants did not afford the same conversion efficiency. Extensive mechanistic studies demonstrate that C2H4 was first produced from CO, reduction at the Cu-0 sites, followed by hydrogenation to C2H6 with the assistance of adsorbed PdClx. Interestingly, we discover that both Cu and PdClx sites are necessary for the efficient reduction of C2H4 to C2H6.

Scanning electron microscopy, Xray diffraction, cyclic voltammetry, chronoamperometry, chronopotentiometry, online gas chromatography, nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy, and numerical simulations of local pH were used toward this end. Ten Cu2O-derived Cu films of different thicknesses and morphologies were prepared and extensively characterized. Aqueous 0.1 M KHCO3 was used as the electrolyte. We report here, for the first time, a remarkably strong correlation between the statistically relevant crystallite sizes of the Cu2O-derived Cu particles and selective CO, electroreduction to C2H4. Specifically, as the crystallite size of the particles decreased from 41 to 18 nm, the Faradaic efficiency (FE) of C2H4 formation increased from 10 to 43%. Using cyclic voltammetry, samples with smaller particle crystallite sizes were found to possess more diverse adsorption sites for CO (a known reaction intermediate), which we interpret to be important for the C-C coupling of C-1 adsorbates to C-2 intermediates. The effect of local pH on the yield of C2H4 for the different Cu2O-derived Cu catalysts was less significant when compared to the effects of crystallite sizes and mass transport limitations.

In this study we have performed density functional calculations on Cu-i/M-j/Cu(211) sandwiched surfaces and Cu-i/M(211) overlayers (where M = Rh or Ni, with varied i and j monolayers). We examined the free energy profiles of the reaction mechanisms for CO2 reduction to CO and CH4. We find that in Cu-1/M-1/Cu(211), in which the Cu monolayer experiences only a pure ligand effect, the influence of Ni is weaker than Rh and it decreases the overpotential for CO2 reduction by similar to 1020 mV. A larger decrease (3364 mV) in the overpotential is predicted for other sandwiched surfaces: Cu-1/Ni-2/Cu(211), Cu-2/Rh-1/Cu(211), and Cu-2/Rh-2/Cu(211) in which the ligand effect is weaker. In the Cu-1/M(211) overlayer, Cu is affected by both the strain and ligand effects, of which the latter dominates. As the number of Cu monolayers increases from one to three, the strain effect becomes dominant in the Cu overlayers. We demonstrate that the tensile strain on Cu in Cu-23/Rh(211) overlayers causes a significant decrease (by 86 mV) in the overpotential for CO2 electroreduction, while the compressive strain in Cu-23/Ni(211) overlayers has an opposite effect. Furthermore, Cu-2/Rh-2/Cu(211) and Cu-23/Rh(211) will also exhibit an increase in exchange current density, i.e., electrocatalytic activity for CO2 reduction.

We report here an investigation of the effects of four different preparations of oxide-derived electrocatalysts on their activity and selectivity for CO2 reduction, with particular attention given to the selectivity to products. All catalysts were tested for CO2 reduction in 0.1 M KHCO3 and 0.1 M CsHCO3 at applied voltages in the range from -0.7 to -1.0 V vs RHE. The best performing oxide-derived catalysts show up to similar to 70% selectivity to C2+ products and only similar to 3% selectivity to C-1 products at -1.0 V vs RHE when CsHCO3 is used as the electrolyte. In contrast, the selectivity to C2+ products decreases to similar to 56% for the same catalysts tested in KHCO3. By studying all catalysts under identical conditions, the key factors affecting product selectivity could be discerned. These efforts reveal that the surface area of the oxide-derived layer is a critical parameter affecting selectivity. A high selectivity to C2+ products is attained at an overpotential of -1 V vs RHE by operating at a current density sufficiently high to achieve a moderately high pH near the catalyst surface but not so high as to cause a significant reduction in the local concentration of CO2.

Our results reveal that the synergy of surface morphology and solvation is essential to the selectivity and efficiency of Cu2O(100) in reducing CO2 to methanol. More importantly, we find that the variation trend of charge distribution on catalyst surface accounts for the minimum-energy pathway of CO2 electroreduction, which could act as a descriptor for understanding the mechanism of CO2 electroreduction and designing advanced catalysts.\nDoi:10.1021_acs.jpcc.7b11842", "label": []}

Although CO2RR on crystallographic Cu surfaces such as Cu (211) and Cu(111) has been investigated by many, the detailed mechanistic understanding of CO2RR on small Cu nanoparticles (NP) is still lacking. In this work, we use Cu-79 as a representative NP and compare it with Cu(211) and Cu(111) for reduction of CO, to CH4 by first-principles calculations. The computed free energy profiles show that the Cu-79 NP exhibits less negative onset potential for the formation of CO than both Cu(211) and Cu(111) but more negative onset potential for the formation of CH4 than Cu(211). These onset potential trends for CO and CH4 formations on Cu-79 NP, Cu(211), and Cu(111) are correlated with adsorption energetics of the key reaction intermediates including COOH, CO, and CHO.

As a result, substantial effort has been devoted to determining the unique catalytic performance of Cu and to elucidate the mechanism through which hydrocarbons are formed. Here we report new insights into CO2 reduction on Cu by electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) in terms of adsorption/desorption of the reduction intermediates. The potential dependence of charge transfer kinetics is discussed on the basis of EIS results. We revisit the mechanism of the formation of hydrocarbons, taking into account the pH adjacent to the electrode surface, adsorption of HCO3- and CO32-, and the role of active hydrogen. In addition to the enol-like intermediate, proposed previously, we proposed that *COOH center dot radicals, originating from the active involvement of HCO3- and/or CO32- upon reduction are key intermediates for the formation of a variety of C2 and C3 products. Thus, our results provide an additional crucial guideline for the design of future catalysts that can efficiently and selectively reduce CO2 into value-added chemicals.\nDoi:10.1021_acs.jpcc.8b05348", "label": []}

The ability to control the surface structure of CO2RR nanocatalysts provides an opportunity to tune product selectivity. Bimetallic gold-copper catalysts have been identified as emerging electrocatalyst candidates, but Cu incorporation typically lowers product selectivity compared with pure Au. Here we show sustained CO selectivity and activity up to 49% Cu content in small (<2 nm), thiol-capped Au/Cu nanoparticles (NPs). Bimetallic NPs containing 49% Cu selectivity converted CO2 into CO with 100 +/- 6% CO Faradaic efficiency and average mass activity of similar to 500 mA/mg during a 12 h electrolysis experiment at -0.8 V vs RHE. Au/Cu NPs synthesized without thiol ligands selectively produced H-2, whereas larger (>10 nm), thermally dethiolated Au/Cu NPs produced a wider product distribution including H-2, CO, and C2H4. Density functional theory (DFT) modeling of CO2RR and H-2 evolution at realistic, thiol-capped Au/Cu NP structures indicated that copper thiol surface structures sustained CO selectivity by stabilizing key *CO intermediates while making *H binding less favorable. Calculations also predicted that removing a significant fraction of the thiol ligands would increase *CO binding strength such that desorption of CO product molecules could become the most thermodynamically challenging step. This result, coupled with increased *H stability on dethiolated nanoclusters, points to decreased CO2RR selectivity for small, ligand-free catalysts, which is in line with experimental observations from our group and others. Our results demonstrate that thiol-ligand surface structures can sustain the CO selectivity of bimetallic Au/Cu NPs and reduce precious metal requirements for CO2RR.\nDoi:10.1021_acs.jpcc.8b06234", "label": [[55, 58, "CO"], [81, 86, "Cu-M"], [774, 784, "Faradaic efficiency"], [61, 80, "surface/interface modification"]]}

Here, by means of comprehensive density functional theory computations, we systematically investigated the potential of several transition metal dimers supported on a porous C2N layer (Cu-2@C2N) as the CO2RR electrocatalysts. Our results revealed that the Cu dimer can be stably embedded in the porous C2N monolayer because of the strong hybridization between Cu 3d orbitals and N 2p orbitals, thus ensuring its high stability. On the basis of the computed free energy changes, we found that Cu-2@C2N exhibits superior performance for the CO2RR with a small limiting potential of -0.23 V and the CO2 -> HCOO* -> HCOOH* -> H2COOH* -> H2CO* -> H2COH* -> CH2* -> CH3* -> CH4 route is the most favorable, among which the hydrogenation of HCOO* to HCOOH* is the potential-determining step. In addition, C2H4 can also be yielded, as the formed CO* provides active sites for the coupling with another CO species with the limiting potential of -0.76 V.

In this study, we investigated the mechanisms of the electrochemical CO2 reduction on an electrodeposited Cu3Sn alloy by experimental and theoretical analyses. The electrodeposited Cu3Sn alloy electrode showed selectivity for CO production at all the applied potentials, and HCOOH production increased with an increase in the applied potential. In particular, hydrocarbon generation was well suppressed on Cu3Sn(002). To understand this selectivity change in electrochemical CO, reduction, we conducted density functional theory calculations for the reaction on the Cu3Sn(002) surface. According to the theoretical analysis, the Cu sites in Cu3Sn(002) contributed more to the stabilization of H*, COOH*, and CO* as compared with the Sn sites. Furthermore, the results indicated that Cu3Sn(002) decreased the surface coverage of reaction intermediates such as H*, COOH*, and CO*. We believe that these effects promoted CO* desorption while suppressing H-2 generation, CO* protonation, and C C bond formation. The results also suggested that the surface Sn concentration significantly affected the reaction selectivity for HCOOH production from CO2.\nDoi:10.1021_acs.jpcc.8b11431", "label": [[562, 565, "CO"], [103, 109, "Cu-M"], [109, 114, "alloy"]]}

The isolated Co atoms lead to a narrowed d-band and an upshifted d-band center which can stabilize chemisorbed CO, on a surface, significantly lowering the reaction barrier. The narrowed Co d-band increases the bonding to a key intermediate, which in turn eliminates the need for its migration and enables a selective and efficient production of CH3OH through the pathway of CO2 -> COOH* -> CO* -> COH* -> CHOH* -> CH2OH* -> CH3OH.\nDoi:10.1021_acs.jpcc.8b12449", "label": []}

Sulfur is doped into the Cu catalysts by dipping the Cu substrates into ammonium polysulfide solutions. Catalyst films with the highest sulfur content of 2.7at% showed the largest formate current density (jHCOO- ) of -13.9mAcm(-2) at -0.9V versus the reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE), which is approximately 46 times larger than that previously reported for Cu(110) surfaces. At -0.8V versus RHE, the faradaic efficiency of formate was maintained at approximately 75% for 12h of continuous electrolysis.

Herein, a new strategy is presented for CO2 reduction with improved C2H4 selectivity on a Cu catalyst by using CO2 capture materials as the support at ambient pressure. N-doped carbon (NxC) was synthesized through high-temperature carbonization of melamine and L-lysine. We observed that the CO2 uptake capacity of NxC depends on both the microporous area and the content of pyridinic N species, which can be controlled by the carbonization temperature (600-800 degrees C). The as-prepared CuO/NxC catalysts exhibit a considerably higher C2H4 faradaic efficiency (36%) than CuO supported on XC-72 carbon black (19%), or unsupported CuO (20%). Moreover, there is a good linear relationship between the C2H4 faradaic efficiency and CO2 uptake capacity of the supports for CuO. The local high CO2 concentration near Cu catalysts, created by CO2 capture materials, was proposed to increase the coverage of CO intermediate, which is favorable for the coupling of two CO units in the formation of C2H4.

The formation of ethylene and ethanol on these surfaces generally increased as the electrolyte anion was changed from ClO4-Cl-Br-I-.

Thus, apart from affecting the morphology of the electrode and local pH value, we propose that the anion plays a critical role in enhancing the formation of C-2 products by tuning the coordination environment of adsorbed *CO, which gives rise to more efficient C-C coupling.\nDoi:10.1002_cssc.201801078", "label": []}

The reactivity of eight Cu foams with substantially different morphologies was comprehensively investigated by analysis of the product spectrum and in situ electrochemical spectroscopies (X-ray absorption near edge structure, extended X-ray absorption fine structure, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, and Raman spectroscopy). The approach provided new insight into the reactivity determinants: The morphology, stable Cu oxide phases, and *CO poisoning of the H-2 formation reaction are not decisive; the electrochemically active surface area influences the reactivity trends; macroscopic diffusion limits the proton supply, resulting in pronounced alkalization at the CuCat surfaces (operando Raman spectroscopy). H-2 and CH4 formation was suppressed by macroscopic buffer alkalization, whereas CO and C2H4 formation still proceeded through a largely pH-independent mechanism. C2H4 was formed from two CO precursor species, namely adsorbed *CO and dissolved CO present in the foam cavities.\nDoi:10.1002_cssc.201801582", "label": []}

As such, catalyst and electrolyzer developments are crucial to achieve industrially relevant ethylene production and efficiency levels. Here, a tandem electrocatalyst composed of copper nanocubes and nickel-coordinated nitrogen-doped carbon (NiNC) is presented, which is integrated into gas diffusion electrodes (GDEs) for direct conversion of vapor-fed CO2 into ethylene. Evaluation of tandem GDEs in the vapor-fed flow electrolyzer shows significantly increased ethylene selectivity in terms of faradaic efficiency and C2H4/CO ratio compared to a non-tandem copper GDE. The enhancements are attributed to the increased local CO availability near the copper surface via effective CO2 to CO conversion on neighboring NiNC. The experimental results are validated by 3D resolved continuum simulations, which show increased flux of higher-order products with the added CO flux from NiNC. The practical viability of Cu/NiNC catalyst is further evaluated in a membrane electrode assembly electrolyzer, achieving 40% FE toward ethylene at 150 mA cm(-2) and 3.2 V. These findings highlight the high selectivity and formation rate of ethylene achieved by successful device integration of the Cu/NiNC catalyst, demonstrating the potential for implementation in large-scale sustainable CO2 electrolyzers.\n\nDOI:10.1002_adfm.202113252", "label": []}

Cu-based materials are the most promising catalysts to realize C-2 products from CO2 reduction, while, they often suffer from the poor selectivity and efficiency. Here, it is shown that -NH2-modified carbon dots (NCDs) can regulate the electron transfer behavior on Cu/CuO catalyst, and then enhance the CO2 conversion selectivity to C2H4. The selectivity of C2H4 (in carbon products) on NCDs/Cu/CuO composites is increased by 1.2 times when compared with that of Cu/CuO catalysts. NCDs increase the adsorption capacity of catalysts to CO2 by 18.2%. Transient photo-induced voltage (TPV) tests are used to reveal the effect of NCDs on electron transfer behavior at the catalyst interface. On one hand, NCDs reduce the electron transfer resistance between Cu/CuO particles, increasing the overall electron transfer rate by 37%; on the other hand, NCDs with electron sink effect can increase the electron concentration on catalyst surface significantly. These effects significantly promote the C-C coupling reactions over NCDs/Cu/CuO composite catalysts.

Here the authors report the delicate synthesis of three kinds of Ag-Cu Janus nanostructures with {100} facets (JNS-100) for highly selective tandem electrocatalytic reduction of CO2 to multicarbon products.

Several approaches including the fabrication of oxide-derived structures, atomic surface control, and the Cu+/Cu interfaces have been primarily used to produce ethanol from CO2. Here, a combined structure with Cu+ and high-facets as electrocatalysts is constructed by creating high-facets of wrinkled Cu surrounded by Cu2O mesh patterns. Using chemical vapor deposition graphene growth procedures, the insufficiently grown graphene is used as an oxidation-masking material, and the high-facet wrinkled Cu is simultaneously generated during the graphene growth synthesis. The resulting electrocatalyst shows an ethanol selectivity of 43% at -0.8 V versus reversible hydrogen electrode, which is one of the highest ethanol selectivity values reported thus far. This is attributed to the role of Cu+ in enhancing CO binding strength, and the high-facets, which favor C-C coupling and the ethanol pathway.

The present work reports the fabrication of a low-crystalline trimetallic (AuCuIn) CO2 electroreduction catalyst and demonstrates its high performance in a gaseous CO2 electrolyzer. The high Faradaic efficiency (FE) of CO formation observed at a low overpotential in a half-cell test is ascribed to the controlled crystallinity and composition of this catalyst as well as to its faster charge transfer, downshifted d-band center, and low oxophilicity. The gaseous CO2 electrolyzer with the optimal catalyst as the cathode exhibits superior cell performance with a high CO FE and production rate, outperforming state-of-the-art analogs.

The Cu-based precatalysts with structural complexity often undergo sophisticated structural reconstruction processes, which may offer opportunities for enhancing the electrosynthesis of multicarbon products (C2+ products) but remain largely uncertain due to various new structural features possibly arising during the processes. In this work, the Cu2O superparticles with an assembly structure are demonstrated to undergo complicated structure evolution under electrochemical reduction condition, enabling highly selective CO2-to-C2+ products conversion in electrocatalysis. As revealed by electron microscopic characterization together with in situ X-ray absorption spectroscopy and Raman spectroscopy, the building blocks inside the superparticle fuse to generate numerous grain boundaries while those in the outer shell detach to form nanogap structures that can efficiently confine OH- to induce high local pH. Such a combination of unique structural features with local reaction environment offers two important factors for facilitating C-C coupling. Consequently, the Cu2O superparticle-derived catalyst achieves high faradaic efficiencies of 53.2% for C2H4 and 74.2% for C2+ products, surpassing the performance of geometrically simpler Cu2O cube-derived catalyst and most reported Cu electrocatalysts under comparable conditions.

Herein, an ultrasonication-assisted electrodeposition strategy to synthesize CuO nanosheets for low-overpotential CO2 electroreduction to C2H4 is reported. A high C2H4 Faradaic efficiency of 62.5% is achieved over the CuO nanosheets at a small potential of -0.52 V versus a reversible hydrogen electrode, corresponding to a record high half-cell cathodic energy efficiency of 41%. The selectivity toward C2H4 is maintained for over 60 h of continuous operation. The CuO nanosheets are prone to in situ restructuring during CO2 reduction, forming abundant grain boundaries (GBs). Stable Cu+/Cu-0 interfaces are derived from the low-coordinated Cu atoms in the reconstructed GB regions and act as highly active sites for CO2 reduction at low overpotentials. In situ Raman spectroscopic analysis and density functional theory computation reveal that the Cu+/Cu-0 interfaces offer high *CO surface coverage and lower the activation energy barrier for *CO dimerization, which, in synergy, facilitates CO2 reduction to C2H4 at low overpotentials.\n\nDOI:10.1002_advs.202200454", "label": []}

This study presents oxide-derived Cu-Sn catalysts tunable for either product and seeks to understand the synergetic effects between Cu and Sn causing these selectivity trends. The materials undergo significant transformations under CO2 reduction conditions, and their dynamic bulk and surface structures are revealed by correlating observations from multiple methods-X-ray absorption spectroscopy for in situ study, and quasi in situ X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy for surface sensitivity. For both types of catalysts, Cu transforms to metallic Cu-0 under reaction conditions.

Herein, we report the synthesis of ultrathin Pd nanosheets with a (111) exposed facet which enables CO evolution to be achieved in a CO2 saturated 0.1 m KHCO3 solution in a conventional H-cell with a faradaic efficiency of 74 +/- 4 % at -0.75 V vs RHE and a partial current density (calculated based on the geometric area) of -0.65 mA cm(-2). Further, to reduce the cost, Cu was introduced into the Pd nanosheets to form CuxPdy bimetallic alloy nanosheets with (111) exposed planes. The composition of the CuxPdy alloy played a significant role in determining the nature of the nanosheet structure and the product selectivity. When 50 % of the Pd was replaced by Cu, competitive CO evolution could still be achieved relative to use of purely Pd nanosheets with 57 +/- 5 % of CO achieved at -0.85 V vs RHE and a partial current density of -0.9 mA cm(-2). Under flow-cell conditions with a higher CO2 mass transport rate, CuPd nanosheets exhibited enhanced current densities in the range of -5 mA cm(-2) to -35 mA cm(-2) but with a negligible change in faradaic efficiencies irrespective of the applied potential in a 1.0 m KHCO3 medium. The use of a 1.0 m KOH solution further improved the catalytic performance generating 71 +/- 3 % of CO with a partial current density of -58 +/- 2 mA cm(-2) at a low potential of -0.6 V vs RHE.

The present work reveals several essential aspects for fabricating performant PTFE-based gas diffusion electrodes (GDEs) for CO2 electroreduction (CO2R). We show that adding an additive layer (a mixture of carbon and Nafion (TM) or Nafion (TM) only) is required for stabilizing the metal catalyst film (Cu), deposited via sputtering on the PTFE membrane, during the CO2R experiments. We found that the PTFE membrane thickness used in the GDE fabrication plays an essential role in electrode performance. The quantification of the products formed during the CO2R conducted in a flow-cell electrolyzer revealed that on thinner membranes, CO2R is the dominant process while on thicker ones, the H-2 formation is promoted. Thus, the PTFE membrane influences the CO2 transport to the catalyst layer and can be used to promote the CO2R while maintaining a minimum H-2 production.\n\nDOI:10.1002_celc.202101279", "label": []}

The reasons for the unparalleled Cu performance in CO2RR are insufficiently understood. Here, the electrode-electrolyte interface was highlighted as a dynamic physical-chemical system and determinant of catalytic events. Exploiting the intrinsic surface-enhanced Raman effect of previously characterized Cu foam electrodes, operando Raman experiments were used to interrogate structures and molecular interactions at the electrode-electrolyte interface at subcatalytic and catalytic potentials. Formation of a copper carbonate hydroxide (CuCarHyd) was detected, which resembles the mineral malachite. Its carbonate ions could be directly converted to CO at low overpotential. These and further experiments suggested a basic mode of CO2/carbonate reduction at Cu electrodes interfaces that contrasted previous mechanistic models: the starting point in carbon reduction was not CO2 but carbonate ions bound to the metallic Cu electrode in form of CuCarHyd structures. It was hypothesized that Cu oxides residues could enhance CO2RR indirectly by supporting formation of CuCarHyd motifs. The presence of CuCarHyd patches at catalytic potentials might result from alkalization in conjunction with local electrical potential gradients, enabling the formation of metastable CuCarHyd motifs over a large range of potentials.\n\nDOI:10.1002_cssc.202102506", "label": []}

Metal porphyrins (PorMs) have the extended pi-conjugated backbone with different transition metals, endowing them with unique CO2 reduction properties. However, few works focus on the investigation of symmetric architecture of PorMs as well as their aggregation behavior to CO2 reduction. In this work, a series of Co-II porphyrins (PorCos) with symmetric and asymmetric substituents were used as model of molecular catalysts for CO2 reduction. Owing to the electron donating effect of 2,6-dimethylbenzene (DMB), bandgaps of the complexes became narrower with the increasing number of DMB. As electrocatalysts, all PorCos exhibited promising electrocatalytic CO2 reduction performance. Among the three molecules, asymmetric Co-II porphyrin (as-PorCo) showed the lowest onset potential of -288 mV and faradaic efficiencies exceeding 93 % at -0.6 V vs. reversible hydrogen electrode, which is highly competitive among the reported state-of-art porphyrin-based electrocatalysts. The CO2 reduction performance depended on pi-pi stacking between PorCo with carbon nanotubes (CNTs) and adjacent PorCos, which could be readily controlled by atomically positioned DMB in PorCo. Density functional theory calculations also suggested that the charge density between PorCo and CNT was highest due to the weak steric hindrance in as-PorCo, providing the new insight into molecular design of catalysts for efficient electrochemical CO2 reduction.\n\nDOI:10.1002_cssc.202200090", "label": []}

In this work, surface cavity effect on C2H4 formation was investigated using Cu2O cubes: solid cubes, cavity cubes, and broken cubes, typically representing smooth surface, cavity surface, and rough surface. With respect of C2H4 selectivity, cavity cubes show the significantly enhanced faradaic efficiency (FE) of C2H4, which is 2.7 and 1.7 times higher than those for solid cubes and broken cubes respectively. Moreover, a ratio of CO produced by CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR) converted to CH4 and C2H4 was calculated to assess the extent of CO further reduction for a catalyst. As noted, cavity cubes exhibited a highest ratio of 29.5%, in contrast with the lower ratio of 13.0% on broken cubes and 14.9% on solid cubes. Consequently, the role of surface cavity is reflected in two effects, the increased CO formation due to higher electrochemical surface area as compared to the smooth surface, and meanwhile the increased ratio of CO converted to hydrocarbons and alcohols due to porous feature as compared to the rough surface with a comparable high electrochemical active surface area (ECSA).

Furthermore, during the reconstruction of CuTCNQ to Cu nanoparticles, the grain boundaries Cu surface is slowly refreshed by continual addition of Cu atoms, thus inhibiting the surface passivation and guaranteeing the electrocatalytic stability.\n\nDOI:10.1007_s12274-022-4446-8", "label": []}

Herein, a multi-step seed-mediated growth method is applied to synthesize asymmetric AuAgCu heterostructures using Au nanobipyramids as nucleation seeds, in which their composition and structures are well controlled. We find that the selectivity of C-2 products for CO2RR could be effectively regulated by tandem catalysis and electronic effect over trimetallic AuAgCu heterostructures. Particularly, the Faraday efficiency toward ethanol could reach up to 37.5% at a potential of -0.8 V versus reversible hydrogen electrode over asymmetric Au1Ag1Cu5 heterostructures with segregated domains of three constituent metals.

Surface modification of Cu has become an interesting method for tuning the catalytic performance. Here, we use Zr-based metal-organic layers (MOLs) as the additive of the Cu surface, which enhanced the Faradaic efficiency of CH4 by two times as compared to the untreated polycrystalline Cu foil. Unexpectedly, the MOLs were found to induce in situ nano-structuring of the Cu foil surface within seconds in the electrolysis, as revealed by a combination of scanning electron microscopy (SEM), grazing incidence X-ray diffractometry (GIXRD), and linear sweep voltammetry (LSV) measurements. These surface changes are responsible for the shift of product selectivity. Control experiments suggest that negatively charged mu(3)-O- on the Zr-cluster in the MOL might interact with CO-covered Cu surface and induce roughing and nano-structuring. This work reveals a potential role of additive on Cu to induce surface nano-structuring that tunes catalytic activity and selectivity.\n\nDOI:10.1007_s12274-022-4461-9", "label": []}

The Cu-based electrocatalysts have been considered for CO2RR to generate hydrocarbons and alcohols. However, the application of Cu electrocatalysts has been restricted by a high onset potential for CO2RR and low selectivity. In this study, we have designed a series of Cu-based single-atom alloy catalysts (SAAs), denoted as TM1/Cu (111), by doping isolated 3d-transition metal (TM) atom onto the Cu (111) surface. We theoretically evaluated their stability and investigated the activity and selectivity toward CO2RR. Compared to the pure Cu catalyst, the majority TM1/Cu (111) catalysts are more favorable for hydrogenating CO2 and can efficiently avoid the hydrogen-evolution reaction due to the strong binding of carbonaceous intermediates. Based on the density functional theory calculations, instead of the HCOOH or CO products, the initial hydrogenation of CO2 on SAAs would form the *CO intermediate, which could be further hydrogenated to produce methane. In addition, we have identified the bond angle of adsorbed CO2* can describe the CO2 activation ability of TM1/Cu (111) and the binding energy of *OH can describe the CO2RR activity of TM1/Cu (111). We speculated that the V/Cu (111) can show the best activity and selectivity for CO2RR among all the 3d-TM-doped TM1/Cu (111).

The copper (Cu)-based materials were demonstrated to achieve the selective products from the electrochemical CO2 RR and received significant attention due to the special morphological features, which enhance the mass transport and electrical conductivity. In present work, we modulated the morphology of Cu electrocatalysts by developing the Cu-aluminum (Al) (Cu80Al20) alloy on carbon paper through co-deposition of Cu and Al elements with a different ratio by a thermal evaporation method. Followed by etching the Al content by immersing in alkaline NaOH solution resulting the formation of nanostructured Cu-Al layer.

Due to two metal atoms in DACs for adsorbing intermediates at the bridge site, it provides an unusual pathway for CO2RR to multi-electron reduction products, which helps formic acid to be further reduced as an intermediate rather than desorbed as a product.

Here, a novel strategy for selective reduction of nitrate (NO3-) to nitrogen gas (N-2) with high efficiency and N-2 selectivity was investigated using Fe-based material (Fe-0-Cu-0-CuFe2O4) combined with citric acid (CA) and ultraviolet (UV) irradiation. In this strategy, the nitrate was firstly reduced to nitrite (NO2-) by Fe0-Cu-0-CuFe2O4/UV process, and then the produced NO2- could be further reduced to N-2 by carbon dioxide anion radicals (CO2 center dot-) which was generated from CA that was added later. In this process, the selective reduction of NO3- to NO2- was a key step.

The selective reduction of NO3- to NO2- in Fe-0-Cu-0-CuFe2O4/UV process was due to that the Cu-0 was the electron enrichment center and the photo-generated hole could suppress the NO3- reduction to NH4+ by Fe-2(+).

Herein, a new composite catalyst consisting of cuprous sulfide and graphite-phase carbon nitride with nitrogen defects (Cu2S/ NDg-C3N4) is synthesized, which simultaneously achieves a high Faradaic efficiency of 82.3% to formate at a low overpotential of 57 mV.

The adsorption free energy of NO on the catalyst surface is lower than that of CO2. Thus, NO is more easily adsorbed on the catalyst surface and reduced to NH3. There are four intermediates (NOH*, N*, NH*, and NH2*) in the process of NO reduction (NORR). NO*, NOH*, and NH* adsorptions on the Pd@Cu BMCs promote the CO2RR process. However, NH2* and NH3* adsorptions on the Pd@Cu BMCs are unfavourable for the CO2RR process. N* adsorption on the Pd@Cu BMCs has no effect on CO2RR. The overpotential of Pd@Cu catalyst is 0.429 V, which is lower than that of many excellent catalysts reported. Pd@Cu has promising catalytic activity and NO tolerance for the CO2RR.\n\nDOI:10.1016_j.fuel.2022.124339", "label": []}

Except for gold, polycrystalline surfaces of all transition metals used for the electrochemical CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR) suffer from low CO2RR selectivities and activities at lower overpotentials. As ionic liquid cations stabilize key CO2RR intermediates and destabilize the HER intermediates, we studied the influence of tetraethylammonium (TEA(+)) cation on CO2RR and HER activities, experimentally, over transition metal electrodes (Cu, Fe, Ag, and Ni). We observed an enhancement in CO2RR activity and major CO2RR product formation in the presence of TEA(+) cation on Cu and Ag. In addition, HER activity was enhanced on Ni and Fe surfaces but suppressed on Ag and Cu surfaces. Density functional theory (DFT) based computational studies were employed to rationalize these observations. Experimental and computational results suggest that the decreased activation energy for water dissociation enhanced the HER activity on Ni and Fe. Further, the increased activation energy for water dissociation suppressed HER activity on Cu and Ag. Moreover, the increase in *COO- (or CO2-) binding energy in the presence of TEA(+) cation is crucial for enhancing CO2RR activity and major CO2RR product formation on Cu and Ag. Thus, this study of the influence of TEA(+) cation on CO2RR/HER activity over transition metal electrodes helps in exploring other ionic liquid cation-electrode combinations in terms of CO2- intermediate stabilization and water dissociation suppression for selective electrochemical CO2 reduction to fuels.

To develop the process on a large scale, it would be essential to use selective and cheap electrodes, and to get high production rate with low energy consumptions. Cu-In catalysts are one of the most intriguing in this context because of their inexpensive cost, high Faradaic efficiency in CO (FECO), and excellent stability. However, because of the low current densities demonstrated in aqueous electrolytes, productivities have been rather low up to date. This paper shows that the morphological and interface engineering of 3D Cu/In nanocones designed by facile electrodeposition can perform very well for electrochemical carbon dioxide reduction to syngas. Under 1 atm of CO(2 )pressure and -0.6 V to -1.1 V versus RHE, the current density can reach -20 mA cm(-2) with a FE of 100%. Besides, an increase in CO2 pressure as high as 9.5 bars has increased the content of CO2, which enabled CO partial current density (j(CO)) to achieve-229.88 mA cm(-2), a new record in neutral pH electrolyte for most of the Cu-based electrodes.

With rising levels of CO2 in atmosphere, methods capable of converting CO2 into value-added products have become more important.

The H-2/CO ratio is tunable from 0.15:1 to 4:1. The current density can be as high as 65.6 mA cm(-2) with a H-2/ CO ratio of 1:1. Density functional theory calculations illustrate that alloying Mo can optimize the electronic structure around Pd and significantly reduce the kinetic energy barrier, thus improving the migration ability of CO* and enhancing the antipoisoning performance of the electrode to achieve more stable CO2 electroreduction. This work offers a strategy for developing new metal- based 2D nanomaterial electrocatalysts for efficient catalysis of CO2 to syngas.\n\nDOI:10.1016_j.xcrp.2021.100619", "label": []}

We report a novel ECR catalyst consisting of CuO nanoparticles with sizes ranging from 1.4 to 3.3 nm anchored on Cu metal-organic framework (Cu-MOF) nanosheets obtained through a one-step facile solvothermal method. The nanocomposites provide multiple sites for efficient ambient ECR, delivering an average C2H4 faradaic efficiency (FE) of similar to 50.0% at -1.1 V (referred to the reversible hydrogen electrode) in 0.1 mol/L aqueous KHCO3 using a two-compartment cell, in stark contrast to a C2H4 FE of 25.5% and 37.6% over individual CuO and Cu-MOF respectively, also surpassing most newly reported Cu-based materials under similar cathodic voltages. The C2H4 FE remains at over 45.0% even after 10.0 h of successive polarization. Also, a similar to 7.0 mA cm(-2) C2H4 partial geometric current density and 27.7% half-cell C2H4 power conversion efficiency are achieved. The good electrocatalytic performance can be attributed to the interface between CuO and Cu-MOF, with accessible metallic moieties and the unique two-dimensional structure of the Cu-MOF enhancing the adsorption and activation of CO2 molecules.

Optimizing the C-C coupling process, the rate-determining step for C-2 product generation, is an important strategy to improve the production and selectivity of the C-2 products. In this study, we determined that the local electric field can promote the C-C coupling reaction and enhance CO2 electroreduction to C-2 products. First, finite-element simulations indicated that the high curvature of the Cu nanoneedles results in a large local electric field on their tips. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations proved that a large electric field can promote C-C coupling. Motivated by this prediction, we prepared a series of Cu catalysts with different curvatures. The Cu nanoneedles (NNs) exhibited the largest number of curvatures, followed by the Cu nanorods (NRs), and Cu nanoparticles (NPs). The Cu NNs contained the highest concentration of adsorbed K+, which resulted in the highest local electric field on the needles. CO adsorption sensor tests indicated that the Cu NNs exhibited the strongest CO adsorption ability, and in-situ Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) showed the strongest *COCO and *CO signals for the Cu NNs. These experimental results demonstrate that high-curvature nanoneedles can induce a large local electric field, thus promoting C-C coupling. As a result, the Cu NNs show a maximum FEC2 of 44% for CO2RR at a low potential (-0.6 V vs. RHE), which is approximately 2.2 times that of the Cu NPs.

Herein, we synthesized three type catalysts with different morphologies based on Cu2O nanowires, and studied their morphology and crystal facet reconstruction during the pre-reduction process. Benefiting from abundant exposure of Cu (100) crystal facet, the nanosheet structure derived Cu catalyst showed a high faradaic efficiency (FE) of 67.5% for C2+ products.

Transition-metal oxides (TMOs) have attracted much attention to OER catalysts because of their earth abundance, tunable electronic properties, and so forth. Defect engineering is a general and the most important strategy to tune the electronic structure and control size, and thus improve their intrinsic activities. Herein, OER performance on spinel CuCo2O4 was greatly enhanced through cation substitution and size reduction. Ce-substituted spinel CuCe delta Co2-delta Ox (delta = 0.45, 0.5 and 0.55) nanoparticles in the quantum dot scale (2-8 nm) were synthesized using a simple and facile phase-transfer coprecipitation strategy. The as-prepared samples were highly dispersed and have displayed a low overpotential of 294 mV at 10 mA.cm(-2) and a Tafel slope of 57.5 mV.dec(-1), which outperform commercial RuO2 and the most high-performance analogous catalysts reported. The experimental and calculated results all confirm that Ce substitution with an appropriate content can produce rich oxygen vacancies, tune intermediate absorption, consequently lower the energy barrier of the determining step, and greatly enhance the OER activity of the catalysts. This work not only provides advanced OER catalysts but also opens a general avenue to understand the structure-activity relationship of pristine TMO catalysts deeply in the quantum dot scale and the rational design of more efficient OER catalysts.\n\nDOI:10.1021_acs.inorgchem.1c02931", "label": []}

In this work, CuO mesoporous nanosheets (CuO MNSs) with rough edges decorated by small Ag nanoparticles (Ag NPs) with a tunable amount of Ag were synthesized on a Cu foil at normal atmospheric temperature through two-step solution-phase reactions for CO2ER to CO. In this special Ag NPs/CuO MNSs heterostructure, the mesoporous CuO NSs with rough edges favored gas infiltration, while decorated Ag NPs expanded the active sites for CO2 molecule adsorption. Ag NPs endowed Ag NPs/CuO MNSs with good electrical conductivity and promoted the adsorbed CO2 molecules to obtain electrons from the catalyst. Especially, the Ag-CuO interface stabilized the *COOH intermediate with strong bonding, which is important in boosting CO2ER to CO. The optimal Ag-1.01%/CuO can catalyze CO2ER to CO with a Faradaic efficiency of 91.2% and a partial current density of 10.5 mA cm(-2) at -0.7 V. Moreover, it exhibited prominent catalytic stability, retaining 97.8% of the initial current density and 97.6% of the original Faradaic efficiency for CO after 12 h of testing at -0.7 V. Notably, the Faradaic efficiency of CO on Ag-1.01%/CuO can retain over 80% in the potential area from -0.6 to -0.9 V, embodying its high selectivity for CO. This work develops precious metal/metal oxide heterostructures with a low precious metal loading for efficacious CO2ER to CO and beyond.\n\nDOI:10.1021_acs.inorgchem.1c03183", "label": []}
{"id": 4746, "data": "Title:Fast Transformation of CO2 into CO Via a Hydrogen Bond Network on the Cu Electrocatalysts\n\nAbstract:In the present study, we have performed ab initio molecular dynamics (AIMD) simulations combined with an explicit solvent model to probe the mechanism of CO2 electroreduction to CO on a copper catalyst. In the presence of an explicit water environment, we have identified an anisotropic adsorption of CO2 at the copper-water interface where one C-O bond penetrates to the solvent and the other one is parallel to the surface. This type of titled configuration suggests a competitive interaction between the copper catalyst and the solvent toward CO2 adsorption, therefore leading to the activation of CO2. It is further found that the C-O bond in the solvent is easier to hydrogenate because of the formation of hydrogen bonds, while the C-O bond parallel to the surface is much more elongated (i.e., activated) due to the efficient charge transfer from copper. Although the hydrogenation is calculated to be favorable at the C-O bond in the solvent, the MD simulations suggest a fast-irreversible proton transformation from the C-O bond in the solvent to the C-O bond on the surface via the hydrogen bond network. This process finally results in the formation of COOH species on the copper surface, accounting for the low kinetic barrier for CO formation. Our work properly rationalizes the experimental observations of CO2RR on the copper surface, which provides a fundamental understanding of the fast formation of CO* from CO2 on the Cu(100) surface at a less negative overpotential.\n\nDOI:10.1021_acs.jpcc.2c01857", "label": []}

A peak Faradaic efficiency of >70% and a production rate of ca. -250 mA cm(-2) toward C2+ products have been achieved on all the catalysts. In contrast to previous studies that reported a propensity for C2+ products on OD-Cu in conventional H-cells, the selectivity and activity of ethylene-dominated C2+ products are quite similar on the three types of catalysts at the same current density in our flow reactor. Our analysis also reveals current density to be a critical factor determining the C-C coupling in a flow cell, regardless of Cu catalyst's initial oxidation state and morphology.\n\nDOI:10.1021_acs.jpclett.1c03957", "label": []}

Here, we propose a Cu foil kinetic model with abundant nanocavities possessing higher reaction rate constant k to steer the ratio of C2H4 to the competing CH4 during CO2 electroreduction. Chemical kinetic simulation demonstrates that the nanocavities could enrich the adsorbed CO surface concentration (.COad), while the higher k helps to lower the C-C coupling barrier for CO intermediates, thus favoring the formation of C2H4. The commercial Cu foil treated with cyclic voltammetry is used to match this model, displaying a remarkable C2H4/CH4 ratio of 4.11, which is 18 times larger than that on the pristine Cu foil.

To improve the efficiency of multicarbon products in Cu-based catalysts, optimizing the *CO adsorption and reducing the energy barrier for carbon-carbon (C-C) coupling are essential features. In this work, a strong local electric field is obtained by regulating the arrangement of Cu nanoneedle arrays (CuNNAs). CO2 reduction performance tests indicate that an ordered nanoneedle array reaches a 59% Faraday efficiency for multicarbon products (FEC2) at -1.2 V (vs RHE), compared to a FEC2 of 20% for a disordered nanoneedle array (CuNNs). As such, the very high and local electric fields achieved by an ordered Cu nanoneedle array leads to the accumulation of K+ ions, which benefit both *CO adsorption and C-C coupling.

Herein, inspired by the knowledge of the thermocatalytic (TC) processes, Cu/ZnO and bare Cu catalysts enriched with Cu+1 were studied to convert CO2 via the electrocatalytic (EC) pathway. Integrating Cu with ZnO (a CO-generation catalyst) is a strategy explored in the EC CO, reduction to reduce the kinetic barrier and enhance C-C coupling to obtain C2+ chemicals and energy carriers. Herein, ethanol was produced with the Cu/ZnO catalyst, reaching a productivity of about 5.27 mmol.g(cat)(-1).h(-1) in a liquid-phase configuration at ambient conditions. In contrast, bare copper preferentially produced C-1 products like formate and methanol. During CO2 hydrogenation, a methanol selectivity close to 100% was achieved with the Cu/ZnO catalysts at 200 degrees C, a value that decreased at higher temperatures (i.e., 23% at 300 degrees C) because of thermodynamic limitations. The methanol productivity increased to approximately 1.4 mmol.g(cat)(-1).h(-1) at 300 degrees C. Ex situ characterizations after testing confirmed the potential of adding ZnO in Cu-based materials to stabilize the Cu1+/Cu-0 interface at the electrocatalyst surface because of Zn and O enrichment by an amorphous zinc oxide matrix; while in the TC process, Cu1+ and crystalline ZnO prevailed under CO, hydrogenation conditions. It is envisioned that the lower *CO binding energy at the Cu-0 catalyst surface in the TC process than in the Cu1+ present in the EC one leads to preferential CO and methanol production in the TC system. Instead, our EC results revealed that an optimum local CO production at the ZnO surface in tandem with a high amount of superficial Cu1+ + Cu-0 species induces ethanol formation by ensuring an appropriate local amount of *CO intermediates and their further dimerization to generate C2+ products. Optimizing the ZnO loading on Cu is proposed to tune the catalyst surface properties and the formation of more reduced CO2 conversion products.\n\nDOI:10.1021_acsami.1c15871", "label": []}

By manipulating the deposition and diffusion rates of Pd atoms on Ag nanocubes, Ag@Pd core-shell nanocubes with a shell thickness of 1-2 atomic layers have been successfully synthesized for CO2RR. Pd nanocubes produce CO with high selectivity due to the transformation of Pd to Pd hydride (PdH) during CO2RR. In contrast, PdH formation becomes more difficult in Ag@Pd1-2L core-shell nanocubes, which inhibits CO production from the *HOCO intermediate and thus tunes the reaction pathway toward HCOOH. Ag nanocubes exhibit high selectivity toward H-2, and there is no phase transition during CO2RR.

We show that the combination of the O-2 flow rate to the aggregation zone during NP growth and deposition time, which affect the NP production rate and mass loading, respectively, gives rise to the formation of either densely packed CuOx NPs or rough three-dimensional networks made from CuOx NP building blocks, which in turn affects the governing CO2RR mechanism.

As part of ongoing upscaling efforts, it is a matter of interest to investigate whether the high selectivity toward ethylene of copper nanocubes, which show a preferential (100) orientation, is maintained in gas-fed electrolyzers, thus enabling the energy-efficient production of this valuable commodity chemical at industrially relevant current densities.

The copper nanocube-loaded GDEs maintained high Faradaic efficiencies toward ethylene at elevated total current densities, resulting in higher overall partial current densities toward this product compared to benchmark electrodes. Interestingly, CO2 reduction to propylene, albeit with low partial current densities, was also observed.

We employ real-time in situ X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) to monitor Cu species under neutral-pH CO2RR conditions. Combination of voltammetry and on-line electrochemical mass spectrometry with XAS results demonstrates that the titanate motif promotes the retention of oxidized Cu species under reducing conditions for extended periods, without itself possessing any CO2RR activity.

The results show that the Faraday efficiency of CO (FECO) for Cu1 is 4 times that of the FEH2, while the FECO of Cu2 is twice that of the FEH2. As for Cu3, there is not much difference between FECO and FEH2. Such difference may arise from the distinct electrochemical active surface area and charge transfer kinetics caused by different copper site distribution. Furthermore, the different framework structures also affect the activity of the copper sites, which was supported by the theoretically calculated Gibbs free energy and electron density, contributing to the selectivity of CO2RR. This study provides a strategy for modulating the selectivity of CO2RR by tuning the distribution of the active centers in MOFs.\n\nDOI:10.1021_acsami.2c00487", "label": []}

However, it suffers from low activity and poor selectivity. Herein, Cu-decorated CeO2 composites (Cu-y/CeO2) with distinct interfacial characteristics were fabricated through a highly controllable synthesis, based on chemical prelithiation of CeO2 and then galvanic displacement with Cu. The Cu decoration induced a strong-binding site for CO2 adsorption at the Cu and CeO2 interface, facilitating the CO2 activation and conversion to the *CO intermediate on the nearby Cu surface. Selective CO2 conversion to C-1 or C2+ products was customized by adjusting the Cu decoration amount. With the increase in the Cu loading, the C-1 and C2+ products exhibited a declining and volcano-shaped trend, showing a maximum faradaic efficiency of 70 and 63%, respectively. In situ infrared and Raman spectroscopy revealed that the reduction pathway depended on the relative ratio of the low-frequency band *COLFB to the high-frequency band *COHFB. Our findings may contribute to the rational design of heterostructured catalysts toward CO2 electroreduction.\n\nDOI:10.1021_acscatal.1c04714", "label": []}

All the feasible mechanistic pathways for the formation of C-1 (HCOOH, CH3OH, and CH4) and C-2 (C2H4 and C2H3OH) based products have been explored using the density functional theoretical calculations, and the most plausible pathways have been identified. The calculated results are compared with the previous reports on the periodic Cu(100) and Cu(111) surfaces and also on the surface of the Cu-85 nanocluster and Cu(111) monolayer. The in-depth mechanistic investigation shows that Cu-NC can be very selective toward the C-2-based products with a lower limiting potential (calculated) compared to the periodic surfaces. The underlying reasons for such findings have been explained and compared that with the periodic surfaces.

Here, two types of metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) based on square-pyramidal CuO5 and square-planar CuO4 nodes, respectively, are compared in regard to their performances in electrocatalytic CO2RR. The MOF (Cu-DBC, H8DBC = dibenzo-[g,p] chrysene-2,3,6,7,10,11,14,15-octaol) constructed by CuO5 nodes and the catechol-derived ligands exhibit high performance for the electrocatalytic reduction of CO2 to CH4 with a Faradaic efficiency of 56% and a current density of 11.4 mA cm(-2) at -1.4 V vs RHE. In comparison, two other MOFs, Cu-HHTP (HHTP = 2,3,6,7,10,11-hexahydroxytriphenylene) and Cu-THQ(THQ= tetrahy-droxy-1,4-quinone), constructed by CuO4 and catechol-derived ligands, exhibit that CO is the sole reduced product. Theoretical calculations and Cu L-edge adsorption spectroscopy revealed that the energy levels of metal d-orbitals (d(z)(2), d(xz), and d(yz)) in the square-pyramidal CuO5 site are elevated compared to those in the square- planar CuO4 site. As a result, the CuO5 active sites can strongly adsorb *CO intermediates and hence facilitate the hydrogenation of *CO into *CHO, which is beneficial for yielding CH4 instead of CO. This work will be helpful to understand the mechanism of copper-based catalysts for the electrocatalytic reduction of CO2 to hydrocarbons.\n\nDOI:10.1021_acscatal.1c04805", "label": []}

Herein, we prepared two types of Cu-Zn bimetallic catalysts with core-shell and phase-separated structure distributions and studied their electrochemical CO2 reduction performance in detail.

Although single crystal electrodes are typically used for such studies, the one-at-a-time preparation procedure limits the range of secondary crystallographic orientations that can be profiled. This work employs scanning electrochemical cell microscopy (SECCM) together with co-located electron backscatter diffraction (EBSD) as a screening technique to investigate how surface crystallographic orientations on polycrystalline copper (Cu) correlate to activity under CO2 electroreduction conditions. SECCM measures spatially resolved voltammetry on polycrystalline copper covering low overpotentials of CO2 conversion to intermediates, thereby screening the different activity from low-index facets where H-2 evolution is dominant to high-index facets where more reaction intermediates are expected. This approach allows the acquisition of 2500 voltammograms on approximately 60 different Cu surface facets identified with EBSD. The results show that the order of activity is (111) < (100) < (110) among the Cu primary orientations. The collection of data over a wide range of secondary orientations leads to the construction of an \"electrochemical-crystallographic stereographic triangle\" that provides a broad comprehension of the trends among Cu secondary surface facets rarely studied in the literature, [particularly (941) and (741)], and clearly shows that the electroreduction activity scales with the step and kink density of these surfaces. This work also reveals that the electrochemical stripping of the passive layer that is naturally formed on Cu in air is strongly grain-dependent, and the relative ease of stripping on low-index facets follows the order of (100) > (111) > (110). This allows a procedure to be implemented, whereby the oxide is removed (to an electrochemically undetectable level) prior to the kinetic analyses of electroreduction activity. SECCM screening allows for the most active surfaces to be ranked and prompts in-depth follow-up studies\n\nDOI:10.1021_acscatal.2c01650", "label": []}

Here, we report synergistic electrolysis of CO2 and CO to C2H4 by concurrently tuning nanocavities and the interface of CuO with a hydrogen evolution inactive metal oxide (ZrO2). The designed CuO@ZrO2 delivers a faradaic efficiency (FE) as high as 54.7 +/- 1.1% toward C2H4 formation and a remarkable overall CO(2 )reduction FE exceeding 84.0% at 250 mA cm(-2), significantly outperforming pristine CuO and many recently demonstrated Cu-based catalysts. The composite also exhibits a markedly enhanced FE of converting CO to C2H4, approximately three-fold that of pure CuO. Operando Raman spectroscopy as well as postmortem X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy measurements verify that Cu+ species are well retained in the presence of ZrO2 during CO2 reduction, in stark contrast to the rapid transformation of Cu+ to Cu-0 in the catalyst without the metal oxide. Experiments in combination with theoretical calculations further show that the incorporation of ZrO2 substantially decreases the dimerization barriers of adsorbed CO intermediates, thus boosting C-C coupling to produce C2H4.\n\nDOI:10.1021_acssuschemeng.2c01600", "label": []}

Among products from CO2RR, multicarbon chemicals, such as ethylene and ethanol with high energy density, are more valuable. However, the selectivity and reaction rate of C-2 production are unsatisfactory due to the sluggish thermodynamics and kinetics of C-C coupling. The electric field and thermal field have been studied and utilized to promote catalytic reactions, as they can regulate the thermodynamic and kinetic barriers of reactions. Either raising the potential or heating the electrolyte can enhance C-C coupling, but these come at the cost of increasing side reactions, such as the hydrogen evolution reaction. Here, we present a generic strategy to enhance the local electric field and temperature simultaneously and dramatically improve the electric-thermal synergy desired in electrocatalysis. A conformal coating of similar to 5 nm of polytetrafluoroethylene significantly improves the catalytic ability of copper nanoneedles (similar to 7-fold electric field and similar to 40 K temperature enhancement at the tips compared with bare copper nanoneedles experimentally), resulting in an improved C-2 Faradaic efficiency of over 86% at a partial current density of more than 250 mA cm(-2) and a record-high C-2 turnover frequency of 11.5 +/- 0.3 s(-1) Cu site(-1). Combined with its low cost and scalability, the electric-thermal strategy for a state-of-the-art catalyst not only offers new insight into improving activity and selectivity of value-added C-2 products as we demonstrated but also inspires advances in efficiency and/or selectivity of other valuable electro-/photocatalysis such as hydrogen evolution, nitrogen reduction, and hydrogen peroxide electrosynthesis.\n\nDOI:10.1021_jacs.1c11253", "label": []}
{"id": 4773, "data": "Title:Stabilizing Cu2+ Ions by Solid Solutions to Promote CO2 Electroreduction to Methane\n\nAbstract:Copper is the only metal catalyst that can perform the electrocatalytic CO2 reduction reaction (CRR) to produce hydrocarbons and oxygenates. Its surface oxidation state determines the reaction pathway to various products. However, under the cathodic potential of CRR conditions, the chemical composition of most Cu-based catalysts inevitably undergoes electroreduction from Cu2+ to Cu-0 or Cu1+ species, which is generally coupled with phase reconstruction and the formation of new active sites. Since the initial Cu2+ active sites are hard to retain, there have been few studies about Cu2+ catalysts for CRR. Herein we propose a solidsolution strategy to stabilize Cu2+ ions by incorporating them into a CeO2 matrix, which works as a self-sacrificing ingredient to protect Cu2+ active species. In situ spectroscopic characterization and density functional theory calculations reveal that compared with the conventionally derived Cu catalysts with Cu-0 or Cu1+ active sites, the Cu2+ species in the solid solution (Cu-Ce-O-x) can significantly strengthen adsorption of the *CO intermediate, facilitating its further hydrogenation to produce CH4 instead of dimerization to give C-2 products. As a result, different from most of the other Cu-based catalysts, Cu-Ce-O-x delivered a high Faradaic efficiency of 67.8% for CH4 and a low value of 3.6% for C2H4.\n\nDOI:10.1021_jacs.1c12212", "label": []}

Here, an anti-swelling anion exchange ionomer (AEI) was first proposed to optimize the local environment for promoting industrial-current-density CO2-to-C2+ electroreduction. Taking the anti-swelling AEI-modified oxide-derived Cu nanosheets as an example, in situ Raman spectroscopy and contact angle measurements revealed that the OH--accumulated-N(CH3)(3)(+) groups and anti-swelling backbone of AEI could synergistically regulate the local pH level and water content. In situ Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy and theoretical calculations demonstrated that the higher local pH value could lower the energy barrier for the rate-limiting COCO* hydrogenated to COCOH* from 0.08 to 0.04 eV, thereby boosting the generation of C2+ products. Owing to the anti-swelling backbone, the optimized water content of 3.5% could suppress the competing H-2 evolution and hence facilitate the proton-electron transfer step for C2+ production. As a result, the anti-swelling AEI-modified oxide-derived Cu nanosheets achieved a C2+ Faradaic efficiency of 85.1% at a current density up to 800 mA cm(-2) with a half-cell power conversion efficiency exceeding 50%, outperforming most reported powder catalysts.\n\nDOI:10.1021_jacs.2c02594", "label": []}

This can only be achieved through the rational material design based upon the knowledge of the operational active site at the molecular scale. Enlightened by theoretical screening, herein, we for the first time manipulate a novel Ni-Cu atomic pair configuration toward improved CO2RR performance. Systematic characterizations and theoretical modeling reveal that the secondary Cu metal incorporation positively shifts the Ni 3d orbital energy to the Fermi level and thus accelerates the rate-determining step, *COOH formation. In addition, the intrinsic inactivity of Cu toward the competing hydrogen evolution reaction causes a considerable reaction barrier for water dissociation on the Ni-Cu moiety. Due to these attributes, the as-developed Ni/Cu-N-C catalyst exhibits excellent catalytic activity and selectivity, with a record-high turnover frequency of 20,695 h(-1) at -0.6 V (vs RHE) and a maximum Faradaic efficiency of 97.7% for CO production.

On Cu-based catalysts, ethylene and ethanol (C-2) have been produced in appreciable amounts. C-3 products (mostly terminal oxygenates) have limited yields, whereas propylene is puzzlingly absent. Herein, we devise a divide-and-conquer strategy to explain the formation of the C-3-backbone and elucidate the mechanism responsible for the observed selectivity by combining network graphs, density functional theory, and experiments to prune the network and benchmark the identified path. Our approach concludes that the most frequently reported products, propionaldehyde and 1-propanol, originate from the coupling of CH2CH with C(H)O.

Herein, we explored the atomistic engineering of the catalyst substrate as a strategy to tune Cu catalysts for CO2 reduction towards different C-1 products by using generalized coordination numbers, GCN, as a structural descriptor of catalytic properties. We observed bifurcations on reaction mechanisms and significant changes in the predicted onset potentials, U-onset, towards CO, HCOOH, and CH4 as a function of the GCN values of the adsorption sites. For each product, we observed volcano plots of U-onset as a function of GCN that indicate activity peaks. We also compared the evolution of U-onset for different products to show that, regardless of the small U-onset values for CH4 on low-coordination sites, such adsorption sites should be more selective towards CO. For Cu nanoparticles, the analysis showed that decreasing the nanoparticle size could lead to more active catalysts that should be highly selective towards CO, which qualitatively agrees with experimental results.\n\nDOI:10.1039_d1cy02010b", "label": []}

From a technological viewpoint, the realization of such process in the gas phase and at room temperature is considered advantageous as it allows one to circumvent the limited CO2 solubility in liquid electrolytes and CO2 transport across the electrical double layer. Yet, electrocatalysts' performances reported so far are promising but not satisfactory. To inform the design of new materials, in this study, we apply ambient pressure X-ray photoelectron and absorption spectroscopies coupled with on-line gas detection via mass spectrometry to investigate in situ performance and interface chemistry of an electrodeposited Cu on graphitic carbon support under conditions of CO2 reduction. We use the ISISS beamline at the synchrotron facility BESSY II of the HZB and the electrochemical cell based on polymeric electrolyte membrane previously developed. We show that under cathodic potential in which methanol is formed, a fraction of the electrode with a predominantly Cu(i) electronic structure undergoes reduction to metallic Cu. The C speciation is characterized by C-O and sp(3) CH3 species whereas no atomic C was formed under this condition. We also show the important role of water in the formation of methanol from accumulated surface CH3 species.\n\nDOI:10.1039_d1fd00121c", "label": []}

Copper has been considered the predominant and effective electrocatalyst for the CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR), especially when aiming for ethylene products. However, the selectivity or current density of most catalysts for ethylene production is not satisfactory at competitive prices. Here, we present a newly designed electrocatalyst comprising Al2CuO4 nanosheets uniformly covered with CuO nanoparticles (CuAl-1: CuO/Al2CuO4-23) by phase and interphase engineering, achieving an ultrahigh selectivity of 82.4% for ethylene in an H-cell system with good catalytic stability and material durability for 100 h. In a flow-cell electrolyzer, this catalyst achieves a remarkably high ethylene partial current density of 421 mA cm(-2), substantially higher than the as-synthesized bare CuO (261 mA cm(-2)) counterpart. The results of time-resolved attenuated total reflection-surface enhanced infrared absorption spectroscopy (ATR-SEIRAS) suggest that compared to the CuO catalyst, CuAl-1 enabled high surface coverages of *CO intermediates and strengthened adsorption of *CO for C-C coupling toward *OCCO, which is an intermediate for the production of ethylene. X-ray absorption analysis confirms that Cu oxide species in CuAl-1 are well retained during CO2 reduction, whereas the bare CuO catalyst is completely reduced to the metallic Cu state. Density functional theory calculations propose that a synergistic effect between CuO and Al2CuO4 in the CuAl-1 steers the CO2RR pathway towards ethylene.\n\nDOI:10.1039_d1ee03861c", "label": []}

In the present work, we have prepared several Cu-Zr bimetallic catalysts and assessed their performances in the CO<INF>2</INF>RR to C<INF>2</INF>H<INF>4</INF> using an H-type cell. Among the prepared catalysts, the bimetallic Cu-Zr catalyst (denoted as ZrO<INF>2</INF>/Cu-Cu<INF>2</INF>O) with a Cu/Zr molar ratio of 7/1 could achieve a 62.5% faradaic efficiency of ethene (FE<INF>C<INF>2</INF>H<INF>4</INF></INF>) with a high current density of 24 mA cm<SUP>-2</SUP> at -1.28 V (vs. RHE) in 0.1 M KCl electrolyte.

However, the scale relationships between the adsorption energies of the CO2 reduction intermediates severely restrict the catalytic performance of catalysts. Herein, we design Cu-M bimetal catalysts (BMCs) to break through the stubborn restriction of scaling relationships on catalytic activity. Density functional theory (DFT) was used to investigate the CO2RR activity of Cu-based BMCs. It is found that the dual-atom sites (Cu site and M site) result in noteworthy deviations for the scaling relationships between COOH* and CO*. The Cu-Cr catalyst shows the best CO2RR activity towards CO production. Specifically, only a low overpotential of 0.326 V is required to enable CO2 reduction to CO. The Cu-Rh catalyst shows a good HER activity due to the lower absolute value. The electrons entering the antibonding orbital significantly increase the Pauli repulsion, which weakens the adsorption energy of atomic hydrogen on the catalysts. The d-band center (epsilon(d)) is not a good descriptor for the HER and CO2RR over BMCs. Cu-W and Cu-Mo have comparable reaction free energies of the first step involved in the HER and CO2RR processes, and are expected to be the most suitable catalysts for CO2RR-to-syngas.\n\nDOI:10.1039_d1nj04689f", "label": []}

However, the scarcity of highly active cathode materials prevents their use in real-world applications. Herein, hetero-structured double perovskite/Ruddlesden-Popper perovskite (DP/RP-P) composites with exsolved Fe-Cu bimetallic nanoparticles are developed via in situ reduction treatment of the Sr2Fe1.25Cu0.25Mo0.5O6-sigma (SFCuM) perovskite at high temperatures. The LSGM-electrolyte-supported SOEC with the composite perovskites as the cathode demonstrates excellent electrochemical performance in CO2 electrolysis. At an operating temperature of 800 degrees C and an applied potential of 1.4 V, the current density towards CO2 electrolysis was as high as 1.7 A cm(-2), while the CO production and faradaic efficiency achieved were about 12.8 ml min(-1) cm(-2) and 95.2%, respectively.

However, it remains a great challenge to reduce CO2 to C-2 products due to the lack of highly efficient catalysts. Herein, by means of a particle swarm optimization search and comprehensive density functional theory (DFT) computations, we predicted a hitherto unknown Cu2N monolayer with planar hexacoordinate Cu and tetracoordinate N atoms as a CO2RR catalyst. Our results revealed that the Cu2N monolayer shows outstanding stability and intrinsic metallicity. Interestingly, the as-designed Cu2N monolayer exhibits superior CO2RR catalytic performance with a rather low limiting potential (-0.33 V), resulting in the formation of a C2H4 product with a small kinetic barrier (0.55 eV) for the coupling between *CH2 and a CO molecule. Strikingly, the N atoms within the Cu2N monolayer were revealed to be the CO2RR active sites due to their significant binding strength with the CO2RR species and their significant spin moments.

In this manuscript, a simple and effective plasma-activated strategy is employed to synthesize a MOF-based single-atom copper catalyst. The bombardment of plasma forms abundant oxygen vacancies and significantly increases the number of low-coordinated catalytically active copper sites. Moreover, plasma treatment also creates a hierarchically porous structure, which can effectively adsorb the reactant molecules. The synergistic effect of the porous structure and low-coordinated copper sites dramatically improves the activity of CO2 electroreduction to CH4 with a maximum faradaic efficiency of 75.3%. Furthermore, the total faradaic efficiency of carbon-containing products (CO, CH4 and C2H4) can reach as high as 96.5% with a partial current density of 47.8 mA cm(-2). Density functional theory (DFT) calculations confirm that the low-coordinated copper sites can be beneficial for the formation and further reduction of the key intermediate to CH4.

The fabrication process entails the selective chemical etching of Ti3AlC2 followed by the delamination thereof under ultrasonic treatment and subsequent mixing with a Cu precursor to allow in situ doping. The resultant Cu/Ti3C2Tx are highly exfoliated nanosheets with a surface area of 46 m(2) g(-1) and are uniformly doped with Cu atoms (1.04 wt%). The CO2RR current density of Cu/Ti3C2Tx (-1.08 mA cm(-2)) was 3.6 times higher than that of Ti3C2Tx (-0.3 mA cm(-2)) besides a lower onset reduction potential and Tafel slope, and higher stability, due to the greater surface area, electronic effect, and quicker charge transfer on Cu/Ti3C2Tx.

Owing to the high oxophilicity of surface indium atoms, their spontaneous hydroxylation results in the formation of heterogeneous Cu-In(OH)(x) surface on monoclinic Cu11In9 nanoparticles, which selectively boosts reaction kinetics of CO2-to-CO conversion as a result of weakening adsorption energies of *CO and H* intermediates on surface Cu atoms.

The zero-gap junction between the catalyst and the membrane can have distinct chemical environments and mass transfer properties from the conventional H-type cell but is rarely studied.

We developed a simple synchronous ionomer/catalyst activation step under alkaline conditions to form jagged CuO nanoparticles whose unique morphological evolution facilitates the C2+ chemical production for the zero-gap MEA electrolyzer. Moreover, under gas-fed and high-current density conditions, computational fluid dynamics suggests that the mass transfer limitation of water as a proton source across the catalyst-membrane layer and cathode kinetic overpotential are critical to determining C2+ chemical production in the range of several micrometers.

Two different synthesis methods were employed, preferential chemical vapor deposition and incipient-wetness impregnation, to generate two different ZnO/Cu morphologies, which result in significantly different methanol productivity and selectivity. The incipient-wetness impregnation method results in a very high dispersion of zinc oxide over both the copper and alumina support and the subsequent formation of smaller copper particles. Preferential chemical vapor deposition deposits zinc oxide directly onto the pre-formed copper phase and yields more developed and ordered zinc oxide and copper phases. The combination of catalytic and structural (X-ray spectroscopy, X-ray diffraction, and electron microscopy) studies indicates that preferential chemical vapor deposition results in a more favorable habit of the zinc oxide in relation to the copper, which leads to more extensive formation of the ZnO-Cu interfaces required to promote the selective reduction of carbon dioxide to methanol. On the other hand, the very high dispersion of zinc oxide and copper in the impregnated sample leads to a less favorable intimacy of contact between the Cu-ZnO phases and results in a higher activity for the reverse water-gas-shift reaction, greater carbon monoxide production, and to decreased activity and selectivity for methanol production. These results, therefore, indicate that the proper contact of zinc oxide and copper phases is an essential consideration for achieving high activity and selectivity toward methanol in the Cu-ZnO system, and one that outweighs the dispersion of the reduced copper phase.\n\nDOI:10.1039_d2cy00224h", "label": []}

However, better control over the catalyst selectivity, especially at industrially relevant high current density conditions, is needed to expedite the economic viability of the CO2RR. For this purpose, bimetallic materials, where copper is combined with a secondary metal, comprise a promising and a highly tunable catalyst for the CO2RR. Nevertheless, the synergy between copper and the selected secondary metal species, the evolution of the bimetallic structural motifs under working conditions and the effect of the secondary metal on the kinetics of the Cu redox behavior require careful investigation. Here, we employ operando quick X-ray absorption fine structure (QXAFS) spectroscopy coupled with machine-learning based data analysis and surface-enhanced Raman spectroscopy (SERS) to investigate the time-dependent chemical and structural changes in catalysts derived from shape-selected ZnO/Cu2O nanocubes under CO2RR conditions at current densities up to -500 mA cm(-2). We furthermore relate the catalyst transformations observed under working conditions to the catalytic activity and selectivity and correlate potential-dependent surface and subsurface processes. We report that the addition of Zn to a Cu-based catalyst has a crucial impact on the kinetics of subsurface processes, while redox processes of the Cu surface layer remain largely unaffected.

Although many metal catalysts are active in the CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR), their reactivity and selectivity are nonetheless hindered by the competing hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). The competition of the HER and CO2RR stems from the energy scaling relationship between their reaction intermediates. Herein, we predict that bimetallic monolayer electrocatalysts (BMEs) - a monolayer of transition metals on top of extended metal substrates - could produce dual-functional active sites that circumvent the scaling relationship between the adsorption energies of HER and CO2RR intermediates. The antibonding interaction between the adsorbed H and the metal substrate is revealed to be responsible for circumventing the scaling relationship. Based on extensive density functional theory (DFT) calculations, we identify 11 BMEs which are highly active and selective toward the formation of formic acid with a much suppressed HER. The H-substrate antibonding interaction also leads to superior CO2RR performance on monolayer-coated penta-twinned nanowires.\n\nDOI:10.1039_d2sc00135g", "label": []}

Cu and Cu alloys are considered to be potential catalysts for CO2 reduction among numerous catalysts. Unfortunately, the product selectivity and conversion efficiency during the CO2RR are severely limited by the unavoidable competitive hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). Here, we developed a facile deposition method based on magnetron co-sputtering to optimize the alloy composition of Cu. As a result, we found that CuAg electrode of Sn addition can effectively inhibit the HER during the CO2RR and improve the selectivity of CO, and the FE of CO can reach 93% at -0.85 V. The large lattice distortions and strain effect after Sn addition affect the electronic structure and further result in the downshift of the d-band center, which causes the Gibbs free energy of the formation of *H on the CuAgSn surface to increase dramatically. Although the formation energy barrier of *COOH doesn't decrease after Sn addition, the selectivity of CO is enhanced, owing to the selective suppression of the HER. This work provides an effective way to improve the CO2 reduction performance of binary alloys by adding a small amount of a third metallic element.\n\nDOI:10.1039_d2ta00250g", "label": []}

In this work, the preparation of hollow Au-x-Cu2O electrocatalyst and the performance of electrocatalytic CO2 reduction to ethanol were studied. Hollow Cu2O nanospheres were prepared by a soft template method, and Au-x-Cu2O composites were prepared by galvanic replacement. The characterization results of XRD and XPS reveal that Cu+ is the main chemical state of Cu in the catalysts. The results of electroactive surface area demonstrate that the electroactive surface area of Au-0.51-Cu2O is the largest. The performance evaluation of electrocatalytic CO2 reduction shows that the Faraday efficiency of H-2 on Au-0.51-Cu2O is the lowest (similar to 19.5%) and the Faraday efficiency of ethanol can reach similar to 18.8% at -1.2 V vs. RHE. Compared with hollow Cu2O nanospheres, Au-x-Cu2O catalysts have an earlier onset for ethanol production and promote the CO2 reduction to ethanol with high efficiency, while the hydrogen evolution reaction is significantly inhibited. Our study demonstrates an effective approach to develop Cu-based electrocatalysts favourable toward ethanol in electrocatalytic CO2 reduction.\n\nDOI:10.1080_17458080.2021.2005246", "label": []}

Herein, a series of carbon nanofiber-supported bimetallic cobalt-copper catalysts (CoxCuy/CFs) are designed and constructed through the electrospinning technique and a subsequent pyrolysis procedure. Small-sized Co-Cu nanoparticles are homogenously distributed on the porous carbon nanofibers, which can significantly improve the utilization rate of metal sites and greatly reduce the loading amount of metals. Moreover, different product distributions and catalytic performance can be obtained in CO2 reduction via adjusting the metal proportion of CoxCuy/CFs. Especially, Co3Cu/CFs can bring forth a 97% total faradaic efficiency (FE) of CO (68%) and HCOOH (29%) at -0.8 V-RHE cathode potential in 0.5 M KHCO3 electrolyte. Furthermore, the hierarchical pores can firmly confine the small Co-Cu nanoparticles and keep them from easy agglomeration during electrolysis, eventually leading to 60 h of stability for Co3Cu/CFs in CO2 electroreduction.

Copper-based materials distinguish themselves from other electrocatalysts for their unique capability to produce multicarbon compounds in CO2 electroreduction. However, the intrinsic active composition and C-C coupling mechanism of copper-based catalysts are still ambiguous. This is largely due to the absence of appropriate in situ approaches to monitor the complicated processes of CO2 electroreduction. Here, we adopted operando spectroscopy techniques, including Raman and infrared, to investigate the evolution of compositions and intermediates during gas-phase CO2 electroreduction on Cu foam, Cu2O nanowire and CuO nanowire catalysts. Although all the three copper-based catalysts possessed the activity of electroreducing gas-phase CO2 to multicarbon oxygenates, Cu2O nanowires showed the much superior performance with a 71.9% Faradaic efficiency of acetaldehyde. Operando Raman spectra manifested that the cuprous oxide remained stable during the whole gas-phase CO2 electroreduction, and operando diffuse reflectance infrared Fourier transform spectroscopy (DRFITS) results provide direct evidences of key intermediates and their evolutions for producing multicarbon oxygenates, in consistence with the density functional theory calculations.\n\nDOI:10.3390_catal11121502", "label": []}

A set of porous copper deposits are fabricated with the dynamic hydrogen bubble template method. The microstructural and Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) analysis demonstrate that current density, deposition time, and bath composition control pore size, strut size, and hence surface area which could be as high as 20 m(2)/g. Selected sets of porous copper electrodes are then employed in the electrochemical reduction reaction test to determine their conversion performance in comparison to a monolithic copper surface. From the gas chromatography (GC) and nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) analysis, porous copper is shown to provide higher rates of production of some important chemicals, as compared to copper foil electrodes. Porous copper with fern-like morphology serves as a promising electrode that yields relatively high amounts of acetaldehyde, acetate and ethanol.

In this study, the catalytic performance of CO2RR on defective graphene-supported Cu4S2 clusters as well as isolated Cu4Xn (X = O, S, Se; n = 2, 4) was systematically investigated based on density functional theory (DFT) computations. Calculation results revealed that the most thermodynamically feasible product is CH3OH among the C1 products on Cu4X2 clusters, in which the Cu4S2 cluster has the best activity concerning CH3OH synthesis with a limiting potential of -0.48 V. When the Cu4S2 cluster was further supported on defective graphene, the strong interaction between cluster and substrate could greatly improve the performance via tuning the electronic structure and improving the stability of the Cu4S2 cluster. The calculated free energy diagram indicated that it is also more energetically preferable for CH3OH production with a low limiting potential of -0.35 V. Besides, the defective graphene support has a significant ability to suppress the competing reactions, such as the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and CO and HCOOH production. Geometric structures, limiting potentials, and reduction pathways were also discussed to gain insight into the reaction mechanism and to find the minimum-energy pathway for C1 products.

In order to promote the electrocatalytic reactivity, the study of the role of ligands in catalysis has attracted more and more attention. Herein, we have developed a copper (II) complex with redox-active ligand [Cu(L-1)(2)NO3]NO3 (1, L-1 = 2-(6-methoxypyridin-2-yl)-6-nitro-1h-benzo [D] imidazole). X-ray crystallography reveals that the Cu ion in cation of complex 1 is coordinated by two redox ligands L-1 and one labile nitrate ligand, which could assist the metal center for catalysis. The longer Cu-O bond between the metal center and the labile nitrate ligand would break to provide an open coordination site for the binding of the substrate during the catalytic process. The electrocatalytic investigation combined with DFT calculations demonstrate that the copper (II) complex could homogeneously catalyze CO2 reduction towards CO and H-2 evolution, and this could occur with great performance due to the cooperative effect between the central Cu (II) ion and the redox- active ligand L-1.

The main challenge of this technology is the wide product distribution, resulting in low selectivity of a single product, however, modulating the surface properties of the catalyst is an efficient strategy to solve this problem. In this study, the precursors of Cu2O and Cu2S were oxidized to the CuO catalysts with different surface properties.

The mechanism study indicated that the excellent performance of CuO-FS for electro-reduction of carbon dioxide could be attributed to the large electrochemically active surface area, which provided a large number of surface active sites, resulting in a higher total current density; moreover, the less zero-valent Cu was produced over the surface of CuO-FS during the electrocatalytic process, which reduced the production of ethylene and thus promoted the production of formic acid.\n\nDOI:10.15541_jim20210547", "label": []}

Here, a tandem electrocatalyst composed of copper nanocubes and nickel-coordinated nitrogen-doped carbon (NiNC) is presented, which is integrated into gas diffusion electrodes (GDEs) for direct conversion of vapor-fed CO2 into ethylene. Evaluation of tandem GDEs in the vapor-fed flow electrolyzer shows significantly increased ethylene selectivity in terms of faradaic efficiency and C2H4/CO ratio compared to a non-tandem copper GDE. The enhancements are attributed to the increased local CO availability near the copper surface via effective CO2 to CO conversion on neighboring NiNC. The experimental results are validated by 3D resolved continuum simulations, which show increased flux of higher-order products with the added CO flux from NiNC. The practical viability of Cu/NiNC catalyst is further evaluated in a membrane electrode assembly electrolyzer, achieving 40% FE toward ethylene at 150 mA cm(-2) and 3.2 V.

Cu-based materials are the most promising catalysts to realize C-2 products from CO2 reduction, while, they often suffer from the poor selectivity and efficiency. Here, it is shown that -NH2-modified carbon dots (NCDs) can regulate the electron transfer behavior on Cu/CuO catalyst, and then enhance the CO2 conversion selectivity to C2H4.

NCDs increase the adsorption capacity of catalysts to CO2 by 18.2%. Transient photo-induced voltage (TPV) tests are used to reveal the effect of NCDs on electron transfer behavior at the catalyst interface. On one hand, NCDs reduce the electron transfer resistance between Cu/CuO particles, increasing the overall electron transfer rate by 37%; on the other hand, NCDs with electron sink effect can increase the electron concentration on catalyst surface significantly.

Here, via rational design of in situ anchoring of Cu SAs (single atoms) on the unique platform graphdiyne, we firstly realize the construction of a chemical bond Cu-C (GDY).

We report flexible Cu(I) triazolate frameworks as efficient, stable, and tunable electrocatalysts for CO2 reduction to C2H4/CH4.

The reasons for the unparalleled Cu performance in CO2RR are insufficiently understood. Here, the electrode-electrolyte interface was highlighted as a dynamic physical-chemical system and determinant of catalytic events. Exploiting the intrinsic surface-enhanced Raman effect of previously characterized Cu foam electrodes, operando Raman experiments were used to interrogate structures and molecular interactions at the electrode-electrolyte interface at subcatalytic and catalytic potentials. Formation of a copper carbonate hydroxide (CuCarHyd) was detected, which resembles the mineral malachite. Its carbonate ions could be directly converted to CO at low overpotential. These and further experiments suggested a basic mode of CO2/carbonate reduction at Cu electrodes interfaces that contrasted previous mechanistic models: the starting point in carbon reduction was not CO2 but carbonate ions bound to the metallic Cu electrode in form of CuCarHyd structures. It was hypothesized that Cu oxides residues could enhance CO2RR indirectly by supporting formation of CuCarHyd motifs. The presence of CuCarHyd patches at catalytic potentials might result from alkalization in conjunction with local electrical potential gradients, enabling the formation of metastable CuCarHyd motifs over a large range of potentials.\n\nDOI:10.1002_cssc.202102506", "label": []}

Metal porphyrins (PorMs) have the extended pi-conjugated backbone with different transition metals, endowing them with unique CO2 reduction properties. However, few works focus on the investigation of symmetric architecture of PorMs as well as their aggregation behavior to CO2 reduction. In this work, a series of Co-II porphyrins (PorCos) with symmetric and asymmetric substituents were used as model of molecular catalysts for CO2 reduction. Owing to the electron donating effect of 2,6-dimethylbenzene (DMB), bandgaps of the complexes became narrower with the increasing number of DMB. As electrocatalysts, all PorCos exhibited promising electrocatalytic CO2 reduction performance. Among the three molecules, asymmetric Co-II porphyrin (as-PorCo) showed the lowest onset potential of -288 mV and faradaic efficiencies exceeding 93 % at -0.6 V vs. reversible hydrogen electrode, which is highly competitive among the reported state-of-art porphyrin-based electrocatalysts. The CO2 reduction performance depended on pi-pi stacking between PorCo with carbon nanotubes (CNTs) and adjacent PorCos, which could be readily controlled by atomically positioned DMB in PorCo. Density functional theory calculations also suggested that the charge density between PorCo and CNT was highest due to the weak steric hindrance in as-PorCo, providing the new insight into molecular design of catalysts for efficient electrochemical CO2 reduction.\n\nDOI:10.1002_cssc.202200090", "label": [[34, 50, "Cu molecular complex"], [1151, 1155, "Faradaic efficiency"], [93, 122, "CO"], [622, 763, "structure control"]]}

In particular, grain boundaries on the catalysts contribute to the generation of various Cu coordination environments, which have been found essential for C-C coupling. However, smooth-surfaced Cu2O nanocrystals generally lack the ability for the surface reorganization to form multiple grain boundaries and desired Cu undercoordination sites.

With respect of C2H4 selectivity, cavity cubes show the significantly enhanced faradaic efficiency (FE) of C2H4, which is 2.7 and 1.7 times higher than those for solid cubes and broken cubes respectively.

The Cu-based electrocatalysts have been considered for CO2RR to generate hydrocarbons and alcohols. However, the application of Cu electrocatalysts has been restricted by a high onset potential for CO2RR and low selectivity. In this study, we have designed a series of Cu-based single-atom alloy catalysts (SAAs), denoted as TM1/Cu (111), by doping isolated 3d-transition metal (TM) atom onto the Cu (111) surface. We theoretically evaluated their stability and investigated the activity and selectivity toward CO2RR. Compared to the pure Cu catalyst, the majority TM1/Cu (111) catalysts are more favorable for hydrogenating CO2 and can efficiently avoid the hydrogen-evolution reaction due to the strong binding of carbonaceous intermediates. Based on the density functional theory calculations, instead of the HCOOH or CO products, the initial hydrogenation of CO2 on SAAs would form the *CO intermediate, which could be further hydrogenated to produce methane. In addition, we have identified the bond angle of adsorbed CO2* can describe the CO2 activation ability of TM1/Cu (111) and the binding energy of *OH can describe the CO2RR activity of TM1/Cu (111). We speculated that the V/Cu (111) can show the best activity and selectivity for CO2RR among all the 3d-TM-doped TM1/Cu (111).

The electrocatalytic results showed that the H-CuTCPP@Cu(OH)(2) nanoarrays exhibited a high acetic acid Faradaic efficiency (FE) of 26.1% at -1.6 V vs. Ag/Ag+, which is much higher than the value of 19.8% obtained for non-helical CuTCPP@Cu(OH)(2) (nH-CuTCPP@Cu(OH)(2)). The higher efficiency may be because space was more effectively utilized in the helical MOF nanoarrays, resulting in a greater number of active catalytic sites. Furthermore, in situ diffuse reflectance infrared Fourier transform spectra showed that the H-CuTCPP@Cu(OH)(2) nanoarrays have much stronger CO linear adsorption, indicating a better selectivity of acetic acid than that of nH-CuTCPP@Cu(OH)(2). In this study, we develop new helical nanomaterials and propose a new route to enhance the reduction of CO2.\n\nDOI:10.1007_s40843-021-1835-8", "label": [[356, 375, "Cu-MOF"], [636, 641, "Faradaic efficiency"], [596, 607, "CH3COOH"], [775, 934, "structure control"]]}

Here, we synthesize Cu6Sn5 alloy on Sn foil (Cu6Sn5/Sn) and gas diffusion electrode (GDE) using laser irradiation. Cu6Sn5/Sn exhibits high formate faradaic efficiency (FEformate) of 87.2% and remains stable at 28.69 mA cm(-2) over 14 h.

Density functional theory (DFT) calculations reveal that the high performance of Cu6Sn5/Sn benefits from the appropriate binding energy of the key intermediates *OCHO. Meanwhile, COMSOL simulation results of CO2 concentration and electric field distribution combined with the results of kelvin probe force microscopy (KPFM) prove that CO2RR prefers to occur around the channels of electrode.

The introduction of N into Cu2O can significantly enhance the CO2 adsorption capacity, binding strength of key intermediates and increase the local pH value, resulting in two-fold enhancement of CO and C2H4 production as compared to bare Cu2O.

Herein, based on well structured nickel phthalocyanine and porphyrin with the same functional groups (MeNiPc and MeNiPp), the influences of heterointerfacial effect on catalytic performances are systematically disclosed.

Detailed measurements and theoretical calculations decipher that the higher CO2RR activity of MeNiPc/graphene is attributed to the unique electronic structures of the Ni-N-4 configurations suitable for well-suited heterointerfacial charge transfer and rapid CO desorption.

This work regulates the chemical composition of Cu-based nanoreactors readily by adjusting the geometrical morphology of metal-organic frameworks precursor. The obtained cuboctahedron nanoreactor containing Cu-N4/Cu2O/Cu multiple active sites exhibits excellent CO2RR selectivity towards deep reduction product (80%) with high current density. Moreover, the tandem catalytic mechanism of multicomponent active sites has been studied intensively. The CO2 molecule is firstly reduced in Cu-N-4 sites to form CO and then the CO is transfered to Cu2O/Cu sites for further deep reduction. The high concentration of CO provided by Cu-N4 sites decreases the free energy of rate-determining step for CH4 products in Cu2O sites.

The copper (Cu)-based materials were demonstrated to achieve the selective products from the electrochemical CO2 RR and received significant attention due to the special morphological features, which enhance the mass transport and electrical conductivity. In present work, we modulated the morphology of Cu electrocatalysts by developing the Cu-aluminum (Al) (Cu80Al20) alloy on carbon paper through co-deposition of Cu and Al elements with a different ratio by a thermal evaporation method. Followed by etching the Al content by immersing in alkaline NaOH solution resulting the formation of nanostructured Cu-Al layer.

An interesting finding was that the faradic efficiency of the final products could be tuned by dealloying process where the composition of the Cu and Al elements has been changed. Thus, the electrocatalytic activity and selectivity of CO2 conversion into C2+ of the modified structure-dependent catalysts have been investigated.

Hence, we employed density functional theory (DFT) to design ten different transition metal DACs to compare and analyze the impact of electronic structures on their catalytic properties. Due to two metal atoms in DACs for adsorbing intermediates at the bridge site, it provides an unusual pathway for CO2RR to multi-electron reduction products, which helps formic acid to be further reduced as an intermediate rather than desorbed as a product.

In this study, copper-based electrodes prepared using several different techniques were compared to the performance of MMCs containing graphite block cathodes. Gas production was examined under both abiotic and biotic conditions at a fixed cathode potential of -0.9 V vs. Ag/AgCl in two-chamber electrochemical cells. All copper-based cathodes showed better methane production than plain graphite blocks except for the cathode made from copper foil which lacked a biocompatible surface. The cathode prepared by an electroless Cu deposition (electroless-Cu) method had the highest current density production of 0.6 A/m2 and methane production rate of 201 nmol/cm3/d, and its performance was stable over time. Both the electroless-Cu and electrodeposited Cu electrodes produced more current than that obtained with copper powders with a Nafion binder (Nafion-Cu), likely due to different surface characteristics such as hydrophobicity and uniformity of the copper layer. The results of this study showed that copper-based biocathodes improved methane production relative to plain graphite materials and techniques for preparing copper electrodes impact bioelectrochemical performance with the highest performance in the electroless-Cu reactors.\n\nDOI:10.1016_j.cej.2022.135076", "label": []}

Here, a novel strategy for selective reduction of nitrate (NO3-) to nitrogen gas (N-2) with high efficiency and N-2 selectivity was investigated using Fe-based material (Fe-0-Cu-0-CuFe2O4) combined with citric acid (CA) and ultraviolet (UV) irradiation. In this strategy, the nitrate was firstly reduced to nitrite (NO2-) by Fe0-Cu-0-CuFe2O4/UV process, and then the produced NO2- could be further reduced to N-2 by carbon dioxide anion radicals (CO2 center dot-) which was generated from CA that was added later. In this process, the selective reduction of NO3- to NO2- was a key step. For this purpose, we synthesized Fe-0-Cu-0-CuFe2O4 composite by simple chemical replacement and in-situ growth process, which made it have a delicate structure with good contact between Cu and Fe and CuFe2O4. The selective reduction of NO3- to NO2- in Fe-0-Cu-0-CuFe2O4/UV process was due to that the Cu-0 was the electron enrichment center and the photo-generated hole could suppress the NO3- reduction to NH4+ by Fe-2(+). In this proposed strategy, 100% NO3- removal efficiency and 96.3% N-2 selectivity were achieved when the initial NO3- concentration was 30 mg N/L and the reduction time was 60 min.

Simultaneously, atmospheric CO2 represents a useful feedstock for the storage of renewablygenerated energy, in particular through electroreduction of CO2 powered by renewables to give hydrocarbon fuels that when burned do not increase net CO2 levels in the atmosphere. In order to bring such renewablepowered production of hydrocarbons from CO2 to reality, improved electrocatalysts for carbon dioxide reduction are required. For example, Cu is the only single metal that demonstrates appreciable Faradaic efficiency for CO2 reduction products that are reduced by more than two-electrons, but pure Cu is not an especially active or selective catalyst for this process. Hence there has been considerable interest in making bimetallic catalysts using Cu in combination with other metals in order to find systems that can reduce CO2 to products such as methane, methanol, ethanol and beyond.

In this research, enhanced CO2 reduction was observed in alcohol amine solution by using layered double hydroxides (LDHs) intercalated with gold or copper.

Since the industrial CO2 sources often contain NOx impurities, understanding the potential effects of these substances on CO2 electrocatalysis is crucial for the practical applications. Herein, density functional theory (DFT) was used to study the effect of NO on electrocatalytic reduction of CO2 to CO over Pd@Cu bimetal catalysts (BMCs). The results show that d-band center (epsilon d) and Mulliken charge values of metal atoms vary significantly after in-termediates adsorption. The adsorption free energy of NO on the catalyst surface is lower than that of CO2. Thus, NO is more easily adsorbed on the catalyst surface and reduced to NH3. There are four intermediates (NOH*, N*, NH*, and NH2*) in the process of NO reduction (NORR). NO*, NOH*, and NH* adsorptions on the Pd@Cu BMCs promote the CO2RR process. However, NH2* and NH3* adsorptions on the Pd@Cu BMCs are unfavourable for the CO2RR process. N* adsorption on the Pd@Cu BMCs has no effect on CO2RR. The overpotential of Pd@Cu catalyst is 0.429 V, which is lower than that of many excellent catalysts reported.

Except for gold, polycrystalline surfaces of all transition metals used for the electrochemical CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR) suffer from low CO2RR selectivities and activities at lower overpotentials. As ionic liquid cations stabilize key CO2RR intermediates and destabilize the HER intermediates, we studied the influence of tetraethylammonium (TEA(+)) cation on CO2RR and HER activities, experimentally, over transition metal electrodes (Cu, Fe, Ag, and Ni). We observed an enhancement in CO2RR activity and major CO2RR product formation in the presence of TEA(+) cation on Cu and Ag. In addition, HER activity was enhanced on Ni and Fe surfaces but suppressed on Ag and Cu surfaces. Density functional theory (DFT) based computational studies were employed to rationalize these observations. Experimental and computational results suggest that the decreased activation energy for water dissociation enhanced the HER activity on Ni and Fe. Further, the increased activation energy for water dissociation suppressed HER activity on Cu and Ag. Moreover, the increase in *COO- (or CO2-) binding energy in the presence of TEA(+) cation is crucial for enhancing CO2RR activity and major CO2RR product formation on Cu and Ag. Thus, this study of the influence of TEA(+) cation on CO2RR/HER activity over transition metal electrodes helps in exploring other ionic liquid cation-electrode combinations in terms of CO2- intermediate stabilization and water dissociation suppression for selective electrochemical CO2 reduction to fuels.

Herein, mixed copper oxide catalysts were prepared by a hydrothermal method, which consisted of Cu4O3, CuO and Cu2O.

To develop the process on a large scale, it would be essential to use selective and cheap electrodes, and to get high production rate with low energy consumptions. Cu-In catalysts are one of the most intriguing in this context because of their inexpensive cost, high Faradaic efficiency in CO (FECO), and excellent stability. However, because of the low current densities demonstrated in aqueous electrolytes, productivities have been rather low up to date. This paper shows that the morphological and interface engineering of 3D Cu/In nanocones designed by facile electrodeposition can perform very well for electrochemical carbon dioxide reduction to syngas. Under 1 atm of CO(2 )pressure and -0.6 V to -1.1 V versus RHE, the current density can reach -20 mA cm(-2) with a FE of 100%. Besides, an increase in CO2 pressure as high as 9.5 bars has increased the content of CO2, which enabled CO partial current density (j(CO)) to achieve-229.88 mA cm(-2), a new record in neutral pH electrolyte for most of the Cu-based electrodes.

Most reports show Cu-In catalysts are selective towards COevolution. However, few show similarly high selectivity towards formate. Herein we fabricated composition tunable Cu-In hydroxides (CuxIny-OH) by the hydrothermal method and studied their composition effect on electrochemical CO2 reduction in detail. Wefound that the selectivity of CO2 reduction products shifted from CO to formate when the content of In increased in the CuxIny-OH electrocatalysts. The Cu rich electrocatalyst mostly produced CO, which could achieve a Faradaic efficiency (FE) to 75.8% at -0.59 V vs. RHE (Cu76In24 based electrocatalysts). In comparison, the In rich electrocatalysts selectively produced formate, which possessed the FE of formate up to 85% at -1.01 V vs. RHE.

However, the re-utilization of accumulated solar module waste and the development of effective catalysts remain challenging in related industries. In this study, nanoporous Cu (NPC) film with an average ligament size of 30 & PLUSMN; 6 nm was used as a substrate for extracting Ag from end-of-life solar module waste to synthesize a bimetallic catalyst for CO2RR.

Stabilizing and accelerating the formation of *OCHO intermediate is the key to achieve high-selectivity formate production. Herein, Bi nanoparticles embedded in pyrrolic-N-dominated doped carbon nanosheets (similar to 10 nm) (PNCB) delivered a maximum formate selectivity of 94.8% (-1.05 V) and a partial current density of - 22 mA cm(-2) in H-type electrolyzers.

However, favoring the CO2 reduction over hydrogen evolution and exclusive control of selectivity towards C1 or C2+ products by restructuring the copper surface is a major chal-lenge. Herein, we exploit the differential orientation of the exposed facets in copper nanostructures that can tune the product selectivity in CO2 electroreduction. The Cu nanostructure with predominant {111} orientation produce C1 products only upon CO2 electroreduction at an applied potential of-1.3 V vs. reversible hydrogen electrodes (RHE), with 66.57% Faradaic efficiency (FE) for methane. Whereas the vertically grown copper nanostructures that are oriented in {110} direction have higher dislocation density and show greater CO2 electroreduction activity (>95%) at the same applied potential, with FE towards ethylene 24.39% and that of oxygenates 41.31%. FIA-DEMS analysis provided experimental evidence of selectivity of methane over methanol at higher overpotentials indicating the mechanism of methane formation occurs via *COH intermediate.

X-Ray Diffraction (XRD) and X-ray Photoelectron Spectroscopy (XPS) tests showed that the metal mainly loaded on the carbon matrix in the form of metallic Co/Cu, and a part metal was doped into the carbon matrix in the form of MN.

Optimizing the C-C coupling process, the rate-determining step for C-2 product generation, is an important strategy to improve the production and selectivity of the C-2 products. In this study, we determined that the local electric field can promote the C-C coupling reaction and enhance CO2 electroreduction to C-2 products. First, finite-element simulations indicated that the high curvature of the Cu nanoneedles results in a large local electric field on their tips. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations proved that a large electric field can promote C-C coupling. Motivated by this prediction, we prepared a series of Cu catalysts with different curvatures. The Cu nanoneedles (NNs) exhibited the largest number of curvatures, followed by the Cu nanorods (NRs), and Cu nanoparticles (NPs). The Cu NNs contained the highest concentration of adsorbed K+, which resulted in the highest local electric field on the needles. CO adsorption sensor tests indicated that the Cu NNs exhibited the strongest CO adsorption ability, and in-situ Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) showed the strongest *COCO and *CO signals for the Cu NNs. These experimental results demonstrate that high-curvature nanoneedles can induce a large local electric field, thus promoting C-C coupling. As a result, the Cu NNs show a maximum FEC2 of 44% for CO2RR at a low potential (-0.6 V vs. RHE), which is approximately 2.2 times that of the Cu NPs.

We report a novel ECR catalyst consisting of CuO nanoparticles with sizes ranging from 1.4 to 3.3 nm anchored on Cu metal-organic framework (Cu-MOF) nanosheets obtained through a one-step facile solvothermal method. The nanocomposites provide multiple sites for efficient ambient ECR, delivering an average C2H4 faradaic efficiency (FE) of similar to 50.0% at -1.1 V (referred to the reversible hydrogen electrode) in 0.1 mol/L aqueous KHCO3 using a two-compartment cell, in stark contrast to a C2H4 FE of 25.5% and 37.6% over individual CuO and Cu-MOF respectively, also surpassing most newly reported Cu-based materials under similar cathodic voltages. The C2H4 FE remains at over 45.0% even after 10.0 h of successive polarization. Also, a similar to 7.0 mA cm(-2) C2H4 partial geometric current density and 27.7% half-cell C2H4 power conversion efficiency are achieved.

Transition-metal oxides (TMOs) have attracted much attention to OER catalysts because of their earth abundance, tunable electronic properties, and so forth. Defect engineering is a general and the most important strategy to tune the electronic structure and control size, and thus improve their intrinsic activities. Herein, OER performance on spinel CuCo2O4 was greatly enhanced through cation substitution and size reduction. Ce-substituted spinel CuCe delta Co2-delta Ox (delta = 0.45, 0.5 and 0.55) nanoparticles in the quantum dot scale (2-8 nm) were synthesized using a simple and facile phase-transfer coprecipitation strategy. The as-prepared samples were highly dispersed and have displayed a low overpotential of 294 mV at 10 mA.cm(-2) and a Tafel slope of 57.5 mV.dec(-1), which outperform commercial RuO2 and the most high-performance analogous catalysts reported. The experimental and calculated results all confirm that Ce substitution with an appropriate content can produce rich oxygen vacancies, tune intermediate absorption, consequently lower the energy barrier of the determining step, and greatly enhance the OER activity of the catalysts. This work not only provides advanced OER catalysts but also opens a general avenue to understand the structure-activity relationship of pristine TMO catalysts deeply in the quantum dot scale and the rational design of more efficient OER catalysts.\n\nDOI:10.1021_acs.inorgchem.1c02931", "label": []}

On the other hand, the CO2 is a sustainable carbon feedstock, which can be used for the production of value-added products. With rising levels of CO2 in atmosphere, methods capable of converting CO2 into value-added products have become more important. Among several methods, the electrochemical CO2 reduction has attracted much interest because it can alter CO2 to other useful compounds even at relatively low temperatures. In most previous works, the electrochemical reduction of CO2 has occurred only when the cathodic overpotential has been applied in aqueous electrolyte system. In such a system, the continuous electric power has to be supplied and the amount of CO2 delivery has been also limited. In this work, we have designed the gaseous CO2 reduction system using sacrificial zinc anode and dendritic silver-copper cathode. Considering that the standard reduction potential of zinc is further negative than that of CO2, the system has been operated spontaneously, in which the Zn electrode is readily oxidized to Zn(OH)(4)(2 & nbsp;)ion and gaseous CO2 is reduced. During the spontaneous operation of the system, the power density of 14.97 mW/cm(2) has been obtained with the production of carbon monoxide and hydrocarbons such as CH4, C2H4, and C2H2.\n\nDOI:10.1016_j.seppur.2021.120350", "label": []}

In this work, CuO mesoporous nanosheets (CuO MNSs) with rough edges decorated by small Ag nanoparticles (Ag NPs) with a tunable amount of Ag were synthesized on a Cu foil at normal atmospheric temperature through two-step solution-phase reactions for CO2ER to CO. In this special Ag NPs/CuO MNSs heterostructure, the mesoporous CuO NSs with rough edges favored gas infiltration, while decorated Ag NPs expanded the active sites for CO2 molecule adsorption. Ag NPs endowed Ag NPs/CuO MNSs with good electrical conductivity and promoted the adsorbed CO2 molecules to obtain electrons from the catalyst. Especially, the Ag-CuO interface stabilized the *COOH intermediate with strong bonding, which is important in boosting CO2ER to CO. The optimal Ag-1.01%/CuO can catalyze CO2ER to CO with a Faradaic efficiency of 91.2% and a partial current density of 10.5 mA cm(-2) at -0.7 V. Moreover, it exhibited prominent catalytic stability, retaining 97.8% of the initial current density and 97.6% of the original Faradaic efficiency for CO after 12 h of testing at -0.7 V. Notably, the Faradaic efficiency of CO on Ag-1.01%/CuO can retain over 80% in the potential area from -0.6 to -0.9 V, embodying its high selectivity for CO.

In the presence of an explicit water environment, we have identified an anisotropic adsorption of CO2 at the copper-water interface where one C-O bond penetrates to the solvent and the other one is parallel to the surface. This type of titled configuration suggests a competitive interaction between the copper catalyst and the solvent toward CO2 adsorption, therefore leading to the activation of CO2. It is further found that the C-O bond in the solvent is easier to hydrogenate because of the formation of hydrogen bonds, while the C-O bond parallel to the surface is much more elongated (i.e., activated) due to the efficient charge transfer from copper. Although the hydrogenation is calculated to be favorable at the C-O bond in the solvent, the MD simulations suggest a fast-irreversible proton transformation from the C-O bond in the solvent to the C-O bond on the surface via the hydrogen bond network. This process finally results in the formation of COOH species on the copper surface, accounting for the low kinetic barrier for CO formation. Our work properly rationalizes the experimental observations of CO2RR on the copper surface, which provides a fundamental understanding of the fast formation of CO* from CO2 on the Cu(100) surface at a less negative overpotential.\n\nDOI:10.1021_acs.jpcc.2c01857", "label": []}

As such, the very high and local electric fields achieved by an ordered Cu nanoneedle array leads to the accumulation of K+ ions, which benefit both *CO adsorption and C-C coupling.

Chemical kinetic simulation demonstrates that the nanocavities could enrich the adsorbed CO surface concentration (.COad), while the higher k helps to lower the C-C coupling barrier for CO intermediates, thus favoring the formation of C2H4.

By manipulating the deposition and diffusion rates of Pd atoms on Ag nanocubes, Ag@Pd core-shell nanocubes with a shell thickness of 1-2 atomic layers have been successfully synthesized for CO2RR. Pd nanocubes produce CO with high selectivity due to the transformation of Pd to Pd hydride (PdH) during CO2RR. In contrast, PdH formation becomes more difficult in Ag@Pd1-2L core-shell nanocubes, which inhibits CO production from the *HOCO intermediate and thus tunes the reaction pathway toward HCOOH. Ag nanocubes exhibit high selectivity toward H-2, and there is no phase transition during CO2RR.

Herein, inspired by the knowledge of the thermocatalytic (TC) processes, Cu/ZnO and bare Cu catalysts enriched with Cu+1 were studied to convert CO2 via the electrocatalytic (EC) pathway. Integrating Cu with ZnO (a CO-generation catalyst) is a strategy explored in the EC CO, reduction to reduce the kinetic barrier and enhance C-C coupling to obtain C2+ chemicals and energy carriers. Herein, ethanol was produced with the Cu/ZnO catalyst, reaching a productivity of about 5.27 mmol.g(cat)(-1).h(-1) in a liquid-phase configuration at ambient conditions. In contrast, bare copper preferentially produced C-1 products like formate and methanol. During CO2 hydrogenation, a methanol selectivity close to 100% was achieved with the Cu/ZnO catalysts at 200 degrees C, a value that decreased at higher temperatures (i.e., 23% at 300 degrees C) because of thermodynamic limitations. The methanol productivity increased to approximately 1.4 mmol.g(cat)(-1).h(-1) at 300 degrees C. Ex situ characterizations after testing confirmed the potential of adding ZnO in Cu-based materials to stabilize the Cu1+/Cu-0 interface at the electrocatalyst surface because of Zn and O enrichment by an amorphous zinc oxide matrix; while in the TC process, Cu1+ and crystalline ZnO prevailed under CO, hydrogenation conditions. It is envisioned that the lower *CO binding energy at the Cu-0 catalyst surface in the TC process than in the Cu1+ present in the EC one leads to preferential CO and methanol production in the TC system. Instead, our EC results revealed that an optimum local CO production at the ZnO surface in tandem with a high amount of superficial Cu1+ + Cu-0 species induces ethanol formation by ensuring an appropriate local amount of *CO intermediates and their further dimerization to generate C2+ products. Optimizing the ZnO loading on Cu is proposed to tune the catalyst surface properties and the formation of more reduced CO2 conversion products.\n\nDOI:10.1021_acsami.1c15871", "label": []}

The as-prepared C/Cu/C nanosheet exhibits a prominent Faradaic efficiency (FE) of 47.8% for CH4 products at -1.0 V with a current density of 20.3 mA.cm(-2) and stable production of CH4 during 12 h operation with negligible selectivity loss.

Moreover, these Cu/NC-NSs show a steady catalytic performance up to 16 h. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations were performed to investigate the reaction mechanism.

However, the influence of metal node distribution on electrochemical CO2RR was rarely explored. Here, three Cu-MOFs with different copper(II) site distribution were employed for CO2 electroreduction. The Cu-MOFs [Cu(L)SO4]center dot H2O (Cu1), [Cu(L)(2)(H2O)(2)](CH3COO)(2)center dot H2O (Cu2), and [Cu(L)(2)(H2O)(2)](ClO4)(2) (Cu3) were achieved by using the same ligand 1,3,5-tris(1-imidazolyl)benzene (L) but different Cu(II) salts. The results show that the Faraday efficiency of CO (FECO) for Cu1 is 4 times that of the FEH2, while the FECO of Cu2 is twice that of the FEH2. As for Cu3, there is not much difference between FECO and FEH2. Such difference may arise from the distinct electrochemical active surface area and charge transfer kinetics caused by different copper site distribution. Furthermore, the different framework structures also affect the activity of the copper sites, which was supported by the theoretically calculated Gibbs free energy and electron density, contributing to the selectivity of CO2RR. This study provides a strategy for modulating the selectivity of CO2RR by tuning the distribution of the active centers in MOFs.\n\nDOI:10.1021_acsami.2c00487", "label": []}

Herein, Cu-decorated CeO2 composites (Cu-y/CeO2) with distinct interfacial characteristics were fabricated through a highly controllable synthesis, based on chemical prelithiation of CeO2 and then galvanic displacement with Cu. The Cu decoration induced a strong-binding site for CO2 adsorption at the Cu and CeO2 interface, facilitating the CO2 activation and conversion to the *CO intermediate on the nearby Cu surface. Selective CO2 conversion to C-1 or C2+ products was customized by adjusting the Cu decoration amount. With the increase in the Cu loading, the C-1 and C2+ products exhibited a declining and volcano-shaped trend, showing a maximum faradaic efficiency of 70 and 63%, respectively.

Here, two types of metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) based on square-pyramidal CuO5 and square-planar CuO4 nodes, respectively, are compared in regard to their performances in electrocatalytic CO2RR. The MOF (Cu-DBC, H8DBC = dibenzo-[g,p] chrysene-2,3,6,7,10,11,14,15-octaol) constructed by CuO5 nodes and the catechol-derived ligands exhibit high performance for the electrocatalytic reduction of CO2 to CH4 with a Faradaic efficiency of 56% and a current density of 11.4 mA cm(-2) at -1.4 V vs RHE. In comparison, two other MOFs, Cu-HHTP (HHTP = 2,3,6,7,10,11-hexahydroxytriphenylene) and Cu-THQ(THQ= tetrahy-droxy-1,4-quinone), constructed by CuO4 and catechol-derived ligands, exhibit that CO is the sole reduced product. Theoretical calculations and Cu L-edge adsorption spectroscopy revealed that the energy levels of metal d-orbitals (d(z)(2), d(xz), and d(yz)) in the square-pyramidal CuO5 site are elevated compared to those in the square- planar CuO4 site. As a result, the CuO5 active sites can strongly adsorb *CO intermediates and hence facilitate the hydrogenation of *CO into *CHO, which is beneficial for yielding CH4 instead of CO.

Although single crystal electrodes are typically used for such studies, the one-at-a-time preparation procedure limits the range of secondary crystallographic orientations that can be profiled. This work employs scanning electrochemical cell microscopy (SECCM) together with co-located electron backscatter diffraction (EBSD) as a screening technique to investigate how surface crystallographic orientations on polycrystalline copper (Cu) correlate to activity under CO2 electroreduction conditions. SECCM measures spatially resolved voltammetry on polycrystalline copper covering low overpotentials of CO2 conversion to intermediates, thereby screening the different activity from low-index facets where H-2 evolution is dominant to high-index facets where more reaction intermediates are expected. This approach allows the acquisition of 2500 voltammograms on approximately 60 different Cu surface facets identified with EBSD. The results show that the order of activity is (111) < (100) < (110) among the Cu primary orientations. The collection of data over a wide range of secondary orientations leads to the construction of an \"electrochemical-crystallographic stereographic triangle\" that provides a broad comprehension of the trends among Cu secondary surface facets rarely studied in the literature, [particularly (941) and (741)], and clearly shows that the electroreduction activity scales with the step and kink density of these surfaces. This work also reveals that the electrochemical stripping of the passive layer that is naturally formed on Cu in air is strongly grain-dependent, and the relative ease of stripping on low-index facets follows the order of (100) > (111) > (110). This allows a procedure to be implemented, whereby the oxide is removed (to an electrochemically undetectable level) prior to the kinetic analyses of electroreduction activity.

Among products from CO2RR, multicarbon chemicals, such as ethylene and ethanol with high energy density, are more valuable. However, the selectivity and reaction rate of C-2 production are unsatisfactory due to the sluggish thermodynamics and kinetics of C-C coupling. The electric field and thermal field have been studied and utilized to promote catalytic reactions, as they can regulate the thermodynamic and kinetic barriers of reactions. Either raising the potential or heating the electrolyte can enhance C-C coupling, but these come at the cost of increasing side reactions, such as the hydrogen evolution reaction. Here, we present a generic strategy to enhance the local electric field and temperature simultaneously and dramatically improve the electric-thermal synergy desired in electrocatalysis. A conformal coating of similar to 5 nm of polytetrafluoroethylene significantly improves the catalytic ability of copper nanoneedles (similar to 7-fold electric field and similar to 40 K temperature enhancement at the tips compared with bare copper nanoneedles experimentally), resulting in an improved C-2 Faradaic efficiency of over 86% at a partial current density of more than 250 mA cm(-2) and a record-high C-2 turnover frequency of 11.5 +/- 0.3 s(-1) Cu site(-1).

Its surface oxidation state determines the reaction pathway to various products. However, under the cathodic potential of CRR conditions, the chemical composition of most Cu-based catalysts inevitably undergoes electroreduction from Cu2+ to Cu-0 or Cu1+ species, which is generally coupled with phase reconstruction and the formation of new active sites. Since the initial Cu2+ active sites are hard to retain, there have been few studies about Cu2+ catalysts for CRR. Herein we propose a solidsolution strategy to stabilize Cu2+ ions by incorporating them into a CeO2 matrix, which works as a self-sacrificing ingredient to protect Cu2+ active species. In situ spectroscopic characterization and density functional theory calculations reveal that compared with the conventionally derived Cu catalysts with Cu-0 or Cu1+ active sites, the Cu2+ species in the solid solution (Cu-Ce-O-x) can significantly strengthen adsorption of the *CO intermediate, facilitating its further hydrogenation to produce CH4 instead of dimerization to give C-2 products.

Here, an anti-swelling anion exchange ionomer (AEI) was first proposed to optimize the local environment for promoting industrial-current-density CO2-to-C2+ electroreduction. Taking the anti-swelling AEI-modified oxide-derived Cu nanosheets as an example, in situ Raman spectroscopy and contact angle measurements revealed that the OH--accumulated-N(CH3)(3)(+) groups and anti-swelling backbone of AEI could synergistically regulate the local pH level and water content. In situ Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy and theoretical calculations demonstrated that the higher local pH value could lower the energy barrier for the rate-limiting COCO* hydrogenated to COCOH* from 0.08 to 0.04 eV, thereby boosting the generation of C2+ products.

On Cu-based catalysts, ethylene and ethanol (C-2) have been produced in appreciable amounts. C-3 products (mostly terminal oxygenates) have limited yields, whereas propylene is puzzlingly absent. Herein, we devise a divide-and-conquer strategy to explain the formation of the C-3-backbone and elucidate the mechanism responsible for the observed selectivity by combining network graphs, density functional theory, and experiments to prune the network and benchmark the identified path. Our approach concludes that the most frequently reported products, propionaldehyde and 1-propanol, originate from the coupling of CH2CH with C(H)O. While propylene and 1-propanol share common intermediates, the former is barely produced due to the unfavourable formation of allyl alkoxy (CH2CHCH2O), whose crucial nature was confirmed experimentally. This work paves the way for tailoring selective routes towards C-3 products via eCO(2)R.\n\nDOI:10.1039_d1cy01423d", "label": []}

Ethylene is an economically desired product, and Cu is the only cathode that produces C2H4 at reasonable faradaic efficiencies. Altering the binding strength of the key intermediate (CO2-) to favor the reaction pathway to ethylene offers an opportunity to enhance its selectivity further. We explore the influence of ionic liquid cations on ethylene/CO2RR and hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) activities on polycrystalline Cu. Alkylated imidazolium, pyrazolium, pyrrolidinium, and ammonium tetrafluoroborates were chosen because of their range of Bader charges on their N atom(s) and pK(a) values. Among all cations, the tetraethylammonium cation with moderate Bader charge on N and high pK(a) of hydration showed the highest ethylene/CO2RR and lowest HER activities, respectively. From density functional theory calculations, it is concluded that the moderate stabilization of the critical intermediate (*COO-) and the decrease in hydrogen binding energy are the reasons for the enhancement of ethylene/CO2RR and suppression of HER activities, respectively.\n\nDOI:10.1039_d1cy01584b", "label": []}

However, among other challenges, the design of active and selective catalysts still limits such advances. Herein, we explored the atomistic engineering of the catalyst substrate as a strategy to tune Cu catalysts for CO2 reduction towards different C-1 products by using generalized coordination numbers, GCN, as a structural descriptor of catalytic properties. We observed bifurcations on reaction mechanisms and significant changes in the predicted onset potentials, U-onset, towards CO, HCOOH, and CH4 as a function of the GCN values of the adsorption sites. For each product, we observed volcano plots of U-onset as a function of GCN that indicate activity peaks. We also compared the evolution of U-onset for different products to show that, regardless of the small U-onset values for CH4 on low-coordination sites, such adsorption sites should be more selective towards CO. For Cu nanoparticles, the analysis showed that decreasing the nanoparticle size could lead to more active catalysts that should be highly selective towards CO, which qualitatively agrees with experimental results.\n\nDOI:10.1039_d1cy02010b", "label": []}

Copper has been considered the predominant and effective electrocatalyst for the CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR), especially when aiming for ethylene products. However, the selectivity or current density of most catalysts for ethylene production is not satisfactory at competitive prices. Here, we present a newly designed electrocatalyst comprising Al2CuO4 nanosheets uniformly covered with CuO nanoparticles (CuAl-1: CuO/Al2CuO4-23) by phase and interphase engineering, achieving an ultrahigh selectivity of 82.4% for ethylene in an H-cell system with good catalytic stability and material durability for 100 h. In a flow-cell electrolyzer, this catalyst achieves a remarkably high ethylene partial current density of 421 mA cm(-2), substantially higher than the as-synthesized bare CuO (261 mA cm(-2)) counterpart. The results of time-resolved attenuated total reflection-surface enhanced infrared absorption spectroscopy (ATR-SEIRAS) suggest that compared to the CuO catalyst, CuAl-1 enabled high surface coverages of *CO intermediates and strengthened adsorption of *CO for C-C coupling toward *OCCO, which is an intermediate for the production of ethylene. X-ray absorption analysis confirms that Cu oxide species in CuAl-1 are well retained during CO2 reduction, whereas the bare CuO catalyst is completely reduced to the metallic Cu state.

Herein, we design Cu-M bimetal catalysts (BMCs) to break through the stubborn restriction of scaling relationships on catalytic activity. Density functional theory (DFT) was used to investigate the CO2RR activity of Cu-based BMCs. It is found that the dual-atom sites (Cu site and M site) result in noteworthy deviations for the scaling relationships between COOH* and CO*. The Cu-Cr catalyst shows the best CO2RR activity towards CO production. Specifically, only a low overpotential of 0.326 V is required to enable CO2 reduction to CO. The Cu-Rh catalyst shows a good HER activity due to the lower absolute value. The electrons entering the antibonding orbital significantly increase the Pauli repulsion, which weakens the adsorption energy of atomic hydrogen on the catalysts. The d-band center (epsilon(d)) is not a good descriptor for the HER and CO2RR over BMCs.

The bombardment of plasma forms abundant oxygen vacancies and significantly increases the number of low-coordinated catalytically active copper sites. Moreover, plasma treatment also creates a hierarchically porous structure, which can effectively adsorb the reactant molecules. The synergistic effect of the porous structure and low-coordinated copper sites dramatically improves the activity of CO2 electroreduction to CH4 with a maximum faradaic efficiency of 75.3%. Furthermore, the total faradaic efficiency of carbon-containing products (CO, CH4 and C2H4) can reach as high as 96.5% with a partial current density of 47.8 mA cm(-2).

Preferential chemical vapor deposition deposits zinc oxide directly onto the pre-formed copper phase and yields more developed and ordered zinc oxide and copper phases. The combination of catalytic and structural (X-ray spectroscopy, X-ray diffraction, and electron microscopy) studies indicates that preferential chemical vapor deposition results in a more favorable habit of the zinc oxide in relation to the copper, which leads to more extensive formation of the ZnO-Cu interfaces required to promote the selective reduction of carbon dioxide to methanol. On the other hand, the very high dispersion of zinc oxide and copper in the impregnated sample leads to a less favorable intimacy of contact between the Cu-ZnO phases and results in a higher activity for the reverse water-gas-shift reaction, greater carbon monoxide production, and to decreased activity and selectivity for methanol production. These results, therefore, indicate that the proper contact of zinc oxide and copper phases is an essential consideration for achieving high activity and selectivity toward methanol in the Cu-ZnO system, and one that outweighs the dispersion of the reduced copper phase.\n\nDOI:10.1039_d2cy00224h", "label": []}

However, better control over the catalyst selectivity, especially at industrially relevant high current density conditions, is needed to expedite the economic viability of the CO2RR. For this purpose, bimetallic materials, where copper is combined with a secondary metal, comprise a promising and a highly tunable catalyst for the CO2RR. Nevertheless, the synergy between copper and the selected secondary metal species, the evolution of the bimetallic structural motifs under working conditions and the effect of the secondary metal on the kinetics of the Cu redox behavior require careful investigation. Here, we employ operando quick X-ray absorption fine structure (QXAFS) spectroscopy coupled with machine-learning based data analysis and surface-enhanced Raman spectroscopy (SERS) to investigate the time-dependent chemical and structural changes in catalysts derived from shape-selected ZnO/Cu2O nanocubes under CO2RR conditions at current densities up to -500 mA cm(-2). We furthermore relate the catalyst transformations observed under working conditions to the catalytic activity and selectivity and correlate potential-dependent surface and subsurface processes. We report that the addition of Zn to a Cu-based catalyst has a crucial impact on the kinetics of subsurface processes, while redox processes of the Cu surface layer remain largely unaffected. Interestingly, the presence of Zn was found to contribute to the stabilization of cationic Cu(i) species, which is of catalytic relevance since Cu(0)/Cu(i) interfaces have been reported to be beneficial for efficient electrocatalytic CO2 conversion to complex multicarbon products. At the same time, we attribute the increase of the C2+ product selectivity to the formation of Cu-rich CuZn alloys in samples with low Zn content, while Zn-rich alloy phases result in an increased formation of CO paralleled by an increase of the parasitic hydrogen evolution reaction.\n\nDOI:10.1039_d2cy00227b", "label": []}

Ethylene (C2H4), as an important chemical material, is a desirable product of CO2 reduction, while the lack of efficient catalysts with high selectivity and activity limits the progress.

The results show that the selectivity and activity of C2H4 production are closely related to the exposed crystal facets of Cu3N NPs. The Cu3N-2 NPs show the highest CO2RR selectivity to C2H4 at -0.8 V (vs. reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE)) with a faradaic efficiency of 61.1% and excellent stability for at least 10 h.

Herein, a series of pre-electrocatalysts including CuO, ZnO and two different ratios of CuO/ZnO were systematically designed by a sputtering process to clarify the correlation of the dynamic characterization of Cu sites in the presence of Zn/ZnO and the product profile. The evidence provided by in situ X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) indicated that appropriate Zn/ZnO levels could induce a variation in the coordination number of Cu sites via reversing Ostwald ripening.

Although many metal catalysts are active in the CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR), their reactivity and selectivity are nonetheless hindered by the competing hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). The competition of the HER and CO2RR stems from the energy scaling relationship between their reaction intermediates. Herein, we predict that bimetallic monolayer electrocatalysts (BMEs) - a monolayer of transition metals on top of extended metal substrates - could produce dual-functional active sites that circumvent the scaling relationship between the adsorption energies of HER and CO2RR intermediates. The antibonding interaction between the adsorbed H and the metal substrate is revealed to be responsible for circumventing the scaling relationship. Based on extensive density functional theory (DFT) calculations, we identify 11 BMEs which are highly active and selective toward the formation of formic acid with a much suppressed HER. The H-substrate antibonding interaction also leads to superior CO2RR performance on monolayer-coated penta-twinned nanowires.\n\nDOI:10.1039_d2sc00135g", "label": []}

Cu and Cu alloys are considered to be potential catalysts for CO2 reduction among numerous catalysts. Unfortunately, the product selectivity and conversion efficiency during the CO2RR are severely limited by the unavoidable competitive hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). Here, we developed a facile deposition method based on magnetron co-sputtering to optimize the alloy composition of Cu. As a result, we found that CuAg electrode of Sn addition can effectively inhibit the HER during the CO2RR and improve the selectivity of CO, and the FE of CO can reach 93% at -0.85 V. The large lattice distortions and strain effect after Sn addition affect the electronic structure and further result in the downshift of the d-band center, which causes the Gibbs free energy of the formation of *H on the CuAgSn surface to increase dramatically. Although the formation energy barrier of *COOH doesn't decrease after Sn addition, the selectivity of CO is enhanced, owing to the selective suppression of the HER. This work provides an effective way to improve the CO2 reduction performance of binary alloys by adding a small amount of a third metallic element.\n\nDOI:10.1039_d2ta00250g", "label": [[30, 35, "Cu-M"], [822, 825, "CO"], [835, 849, "Faradaic efficiency"], [642, 648, "alloy"]]}

In this work, the preparation of hollow Au-x-Cu2O electrocatalyst and the performance of electrocatalytic CO2 reduction to ethanol were studied. Hollow Cu2O nanospheres were prepared by a soft template method, and Au-x-Cu2O composites were prepared by galvanic replacement. The characterization results of XRD and XPS reveal that Cu+ is the main chemical state of Cu in the catalysts. The results of electroactive surface area demonstrate that the electroactive surface area of Au-0.51-Cu2O is the largest. The performance evaluation of electrocatalytic CO2 reduction shows that the Faraday efficiency of H-2 on Au-0.51-Cu2O is the lowest (similar to 19.5%) and the Faraday efficiency of ethanol can reach similar to 18.8% at -1.2 V vs. RHE. Compared with hollow Cu2O nanospheres, Au-x-Cu2O catalysts have an earlier onset for ethanol production and promote the CO2 reduction to ethanol with high efficiency, while the hydrogen evolution reaction is significantly inhibited.

Herein, a series of carbon nanofiber-supported bimetallic cobalt-copper catalysts (CoxCuy/CFs) are designed and constructed through the electrospinning technique and a subsequent pyrolysis procedure. Small-sized Co-Cu nanoparticles are homogenously distributed on the porous carbon nanofibers, which can significantly improve the utilization rate of metal sites and greatly reduce the loading amount of metals. Moreover, different product distributions and catalytic performance can be obtained in CO2 reduction via adjusting the metal proportion of CoxCuy/CFs. Especially, Co3Cu/CFs can bring forth a 97% total faradaic efficiency (FE) of CO (68%) and HCOOH (29%) at -0.8 V-RHE cathode potential in 0.5 M KHCO3 electrolyte. Furthermore, the hierarchical pores can firmly confine the small Co-Cu nanoparticles and keep them from easy agglomeration during electrolysis, eventually leading to 60 h of stability for Co3Cu/CFs in CO2 electroreduction.

A set of porous copper deposits are fabricated with the dynamic hydrogen bubble template method.

From the gas chromatography (GC) and nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) analysis, porous copper is shown to provide higher rates of production of some important chemicals, as compared to copper foil electrodes. Porous copper with fern-like morphology serves as a promising electrode that yields relatively high amounts of acetaldehyde, acetate and ethanol.

Copper-based materials distinguish themselves from other electrocatalysts for their unique capability to produce multicarbon compounds in CO2 electroreduction. However, the intrinsic active composition and C-C coupling mechanism of copper-based catalysts are still ambiguous. This is largely due to the absence of appropriate in situ approaches to monitor the complicated processes of CO2 electroreduction. Here, we adopted operando spectroscopy techniques, including Raman and infrared, to investigate the evolution of compositions and intermediates during gas-phase CO2 electroreduction on Cu foam, Cu2O nanowire and CuO nanowire catalysts. Although all the three copper-based catalysts possessed the activity of electroreducing gas-phase CO2 to multicarbon oxygenates, Cu2O nanowires showed the much superior performance with a 71.9% Faradaic efficiency of acetaldehyde.

Calculation results revealed that the most thermodynamically feasible product is CH3OH among the C1 products on Cu4X2 clusters, in which the Cu4S2 cluster has the best activity concerning CH3OH synthesis with a limiting potential of -0.48 V. When the Cu4S2 cluster was further supported on defective graphene, the strong interaction between cluster and substrate could greatly improve the performance via tuning the electronic structure and improving the stability of the Cu4S2 cluster. The calculated free energy diagram indicated that it is also more energetically preferable for CH3OH production with a low limiting potential of -0.35 V. Besides, the defective graphene support has a significant ability to suppress the competing reactions, such as the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and CO and HCOOH production.
